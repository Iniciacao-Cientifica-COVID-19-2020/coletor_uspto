<BR><BR> This invention relates to molecular delivery across a lipid bilayer.  More specifically, this invention relates the use of acetylsalicyclic acid and acetic acid to enhance the delivery of target molecules across the membrane of a cell.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The cell membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer having integral proteins and forms the outer-most layer of a cell.  One crucial feature of the membrane is its selective permeability.  The ability of various compounds and molecules to enter and
exit the cell depends upon the size, charge and other chemical properties of the molecule.  If a particle is too large, or its properties incompatible with diffusion across the membrane, the particle must enter through another route, such as a protein
channel or the molecule could enter through endocytosis.  These alternative routes nevertheless remain as significant limitations to entry.
<BR><BR> A number of methods have been developed to facilitate the delivery of compounds across the cell membrane and into the cell.  Among the chemical methods, calcium phosphate has been used for many years to introduce DNA into a cell.  In performing
the procedure, a precipitate of calcium phosphate is formed, which binds to the DNA in the precipitate solution.  When a suspension of the solution is added to the cells to be transfected, the cells take up the precipitate, and with it the bound nucleic
acid.  Liposome-based transfection has emerged in recent years as a widely practiced method of delivering foreign compounds to the interior of a cell.  Liposomes are spherical vesicles that can be used to deliver compounds, such as drugs or nucleic
acids, to the interior of a cell.  In delivering the compound, the liposome fuses with cell membrane, allowing the content of the vesicle to gain access to the cell's interior.
<BR><BR> An additional technique for delivering molecules to the interior of a cell is electroporation.  Electroporation is performed by exposing the cells to an electric potential that traverses the cell membrane.  While its mechanism is not fully
understood, electroporation is believed to involve the breakdown of the cell membrane lipid bilayer leading to the formation of transient or permanent pores in the membrane that permit the chemical species to enter the cell by diffusion.  The electric
potential is typically applied in pulses, and whether the pore formation is reversible or irreversible depends on such parameters as the amplitude, length, shape and repetition rate of the pulses, in addition to the type and development stage of the
cell.  Electroporation has many advantages, including simplicity and effectiveness across a wide variety of cells.  Additionally, it can be used in conjunction with other techniques to improve the efficiency of those techniques.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention provides for a system and method whereby aspirin and acetic acid help to permeabilize cell membranes to allow exogenous molecules to gain access to the cell interior.  As such, the present invention provides a low cost drug
and gene delivery tool that can be applied in combination with other molecular delivery methods.

mM.  In a particularly advantageous embodiment the concentration of acetylsalicyclic acid is about 10 mM.  In further advantageous embodiments the applied electric field is between about 500 V/cm and about 1000 V/cm.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<BR><BR> The present invention provides for a system and method whereby aspirin and acetic acid help to permeabilize cell membranes to allow exogenous molecules to gain access to the cell interior.  As such, the present invention provides a low cost drug
and gene delivery tool that can be applied in combination with other molecular delivery methods.
<BR><BR> As used herein the term "substance" is meant to refer to an element, charged species or compound, such as chemicals, drugs, proteins, and nucleic acids.
<BR><BR> The invention is described below in examples which are intended to further describe the invention without limitation to its scope.
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR>Effects of Salicylic Acid on Calcein Delivered by Electroporation
<BR><BR> The effects of salicylic acid ("SA") on the delivery of calcein to B16-F10 cells using electroporation was studied.  Three identical experiments were carried out.  FIG. 6 shows mean spectrofluorometric data for these experiments.  All cells were
exposed to 120 .mu.M calcein.  In addition, cells in some samples were exposed to one of three different concentrations of salicyclic acid (1 mM, 5 mM, or 10 mM) with pH values of 6.70, 6.32, and 3.85, respectively.  Pulses with one of four different
field strengths were also applied (500, 750, 1000, or 1385 V/cm) to certain samples.  Salicyclic acid concentration and field strength were experimental variables; however, some cells were not exposed to applied fields or salicyclic acid for
comparison/control purposes.
<BR><BR> The results demonstrated that when cells were exposed to calcein and the three concentrations of SA (no applied electric field), salicyclic acid did not augment the delivery when compared to samples exposed to calcein alone.  Overall, the data
for samples treated with calcein and either 1, 5, or 10 mM salicyclic acid and electrical pulses were not significantly higher in fluorescent magnitude than any of the samples that were treated with calcein and pulses (no salicyclic acid).
<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR>Effects of Acetylsalicylic Acid on Calcein Delivered by Electroporation
<BR><BR> Delivery of calcein using aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or "ASA") was studied.  The treatments were similar to those in the previous section in that three concentrations of aspirin were used (1 mMl.  5 mM, or 10 mM) with pH values of 6.39, 5.40,
and 4.40, respectively.  The same range of pulsing conditions was used and the variables were identical for the sample treatment.  FIG. 7 shows the mean data from three replicate experiments.
<BR><BR> The data indicates that exposure to 1 mM or 5 mM ASA (alone) did not result in a significant increase in fluorescence magnitude when compared to the treatment of 120 M calcein alone (no ASA).  In addition, samples treated with 1 and 5 mM ASA
that were also exposed to electric fields had mean fluorescence magnitude that were not significantly different from those samples that were exposed to electric fields alone (no ASA).  In contrast, samples that were exposed to calcein in 10 mM ASA (no
pulses) had an average fluorescent magnitude of 4.28 (SEM=0.63) and samples that were exposed to calcein (no ASA or pulses) had mean fluorescent magnitude 0.83 (SEM=0.05).  This 5-fold increase in internalized calcein that resulted from exposure to 10 mM
ASA was statistically significant when compared to the control sample (p&lt;0.0001).  FIG. 7 also demonstrates that 10 mM ASA assisted in the delivery of calcein at each of the four electric fields.  As the applied field was increased, the fluorescence
remained at an elevated magnitude relative to samples that were exposed to 10 mM ASA (alone) and to samples that were exposed to the same electric fields alone.  At 500 V/cm (and 10 mM ASA), there was a 3.7-fold increase in fluorescence magnitude
relative to samples treated with calcein at 500 V/cm (no ASA).  These same increases at 750, 1000, and 1385 V/cm were 3.82, 3.57, and 3.18-fold, respectively.  The mean data with samples treated at each field were significantly different from analogous
samples that did not include ASA.  The p-values of these comparisons were &lt;0.0001(500 V/cm), 0.0011(750 V/cm), 0.0014(1000 V/cm), and 0.0066 (1385 V/cm).  Therefore, these data clearly show that 10 mM ASA alone can augment calcein delivery alone to
the exterior of cells and also enhance delivery as a result of electroporation.
<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR>Effects of Acetic Acid on Calcein Delivered by Electroporation
<BR><BR> Calcein delivery by electroporation using acetic acid ("AA") as an effector was studied.  The set of 3 replicate experiments included three concentrations of AA, each with a different pH (4.40, 5.36, or 6.42).  The pH values of the three
solutions of acetic acid were matched to those of ASA for the purpose of determining if AA is the derivative in ASA that enhances the delivery of calcein.  The three concentrations of the AA solutions in PBS were similar, which was about 0.15%, and
varied slightly in order to establish the desired pH value.  In addition, one of three electric field strengths were applied to cells (500, 750, or 1000 V/cm).  Some cells were not exposed to applied fields or any concentration of AA for purposes of
comparison and control.
<BR><BR> Samples treated with acetic acid failed to show a significant increase in fluorescence magnitude at higher pH (5.36 or 6.42) regardless of whether or not pulses were applied, when compared to samples not exposed to AA.  However, FIG. 8 shows
that acetic acid had a tremendous effect on the delivery of calcein, using a low pH solution (pH 4.40).  The data for samples treated with AA alone (no pulses with a mean fluorescence magnitude of 1.04) was significantly different in mean fluorescence
when compared to control samples that were not treated with AA or pulses (mean fluorescence magnitude of 8.57).  This was an 8.2-fold increase.  When electric fields were used in combination with the lowest pH solution of AA, fluorescent data was even
higher than when this concentration of AA was used alone (no pulses).
<BR><BR> The data for samples treated with AA and electrical pulses was significantly higher than any of the samples that were treated with calcein and pulses (no AA).  At the lowest applied field, 500 V/cm, acetic acid augmented the resulting
fluorescence magnitude by 3-fold.  The mean fluorescence magnitudes were 12.77 for samples treated with AA (pH 4.40) and 4.19 for the samples that were not exposed to AA.  This difference was significant (p&lt;0.0001).  For the 750 V/cm samples, this
same increase was 2.25-fold and was statistically significant (p= 0.0002).  Similarly, there was a 3.5-fold increase for the 1000 V/cm samples.  This increase was also significant (p&lt;0.0001).
<BR><BR> As a result of this data, a low pH (4.40) solution of acetic acid is clearly a candidate to augment calcein for optimal E.P.  delivery of calcein in B16F10 cells at any of the three electric fields, though it is often desired to apply lower
field strengths to minimize the possibility of cellular damage.
<BR><BR>Example 4
<BR><BR>Membrane Recovery
<BR><BR> Acetic acid was chosen for further investigation of the effects of treatment on cell membranes.  It is desirable to achieve intact cell membranes following delivery methodology.  The trypan blue test was used to determine membrane integrity. 
Trypan blue dye will only penetrate into cells that have porous membranes.  The electric field strength of 750 V/cm was applied to triplicate wells containing PBS alone as well as acetic acid (pH 4.40) alone.  In addition, for comparison, individual
treatments of PBS and acetic acid (pH 4.40) without electrical pulses were investigated.  The protocol used was similar to the methods described for the delivery of calcein.  After one hour of exposure at 37.degree.  the cells were washed three times
with 500 .mu.l aliquots of PBS.  Liquid from the last wash was carefully aspirated, and then filled with 500 .mu.l of growth media.
<BR><BR> FIG. 9 illustrates the time duration of membrane recovery after exposure.  Treatments with PBS alone (no pulses) and with 750 V/cm applied electric field yielded between 90-100% membrane recovery during the 24 hours of observation.  However,
acetic acid alone had a greater impact on the recovery of the cells, ranging from an average of 80-95% membrane integrity.  At a time of 1 hour post-treatment for samples treated with acetic acid at 750 V/cm, there was a 17% decline in the number of
cells with intact membranes, implying that some of the cells either did not survive after exposure or were permeabilized.  The number of cells that excluded the trypan blue dye then increased as the hours proceeded to a value of 86% after 24 hours.  90%
of the cells exposed to AA alone had intact membranes 24 hours after treatment.
<BR><BR> Observations
<BR><BR> Both aspirin and acetic acid, when administered alone, showed the ability to augment the entry of nonpermeant calcein into cells.  The addition of electroporation to treatment with acetic acid or aspirin led to further increases in internalized
calcein.  Cells recovered from the treatment to have intact membranes within several hours.
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Cell Preparation Cell Line and Growth:
<BR><BR> B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells (ATCC#:CRL-6475) were obtained and grown in McCoy's Media (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc., Herndon.  VA), adjusted to contain 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc.) and (25 mg) gentamicin 50 mg/mL (Mediatech,
Inc.) and were incubated in 5% CO.sub.2 at 37.degree.  C. Serum was essential for many reasons.  It provided hormonal factors that stimulated cell growth and function.  It also contains essential proteins, amino acids, minerals, and lipids.  Gentamicin
is an antibiotic used as a preventative measure to help reduce microbial growth and contamination.
<BR><BR> B16-F10 cells grow exponentially as adherent monolayers (FIG. 1), and require fluid renewal and/or sub-culturing every 2 to 3 days using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma Chemical Co., St.  Louis, Mo.) for detachment.
<BR><BR> Cells were prepared for experiments by first harvesting by trypsinization and then washing 3 times by centrifugation.  Cells were centrifuged (5810R, Eppendorf, Westbury, N.Y.) at 220.times.g for 5 minutes at 37.degree.  C. and resuspended in
approximately 2.5 ml of PBS for each wash.  A sample of cells was then diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (APP, Schaumburg, Ill.) and 0.4% trypan blue stain (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc.).  Trypan blue is an indicator in which the membranes of non-viable cells
are penetrated and can be distinguished from the viable cells.  Using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, Pa.), the viable and nonviable cells were counted.  The number of cells per milliliter was computed by multiplying the number of cells
counted per square millimeter.times.the dilution (when used).times.10,000 (conversion factor).  Only those cultures that resulted in 80% to 100% viability were used for experimentation.
<BR><BR> Experiments were conducted using 48-well polystyrene tissue culture plates (BD Falcon.  Franklin Lakes, N.J.).  Each well held approximately 1.4 ml of liquid with a surface area of 0.75 cm.sup.2.  The depth and diameter of each well was 18 mm
and 10 mm, respectively.
<BR><BR> It was found that pre-treatment of the wells with a 0.1% gelatin (Acros, N.J., USA; Geel, Belgium) film coat reduced loosening of the cells after electrical stimulation.  Under aseptic conditions, 150 .mu.l of the sterile gelatin solution was
added to each well and let stand for 1 hour.  The gelatin was then aspirated from each of the wells and air dried for 5 minutes.  500 .mu.l of McCoy's Media was added to the treated wells in addition to 7.5.times.10.sup.4 viable cells and incubated at
37.degree.  C. for 18 hours before treatment.
<BR><BR> Electrode:
<BR><BR> Gilbert et al. designed and compared several innovative electrodes for use in electrochemotherapy treatment of murine B16 melanoma tumors.  They found that a 6-needle array was the most successful when tested in vivo, measured statistically by a
97.1% complete response rate.
<BR><BR> The electrode shown in FIG. 2 was specially designed for all experimentation in these studies and was similar to the design mentioned above.  The electrode consisted of 6 stainless steel electrodes, equally spaced at 60.degree.  intervals around
a 0.7 cm diameter circle.  The needles extended 1.8 cm from the electrode body to fit precisely in the wells in order to set flush against the treatment/cell growth surface.
<BR><BR> Cells in each well were treated with a total of 12 DC pulses.  FIG. 3 illustrates the sequence pattern used to energize specific needles, where each small circle represents the location of each needle.  Pulses were directed to each needle by a
rotary switch.  Needles 1 & 2 were negative (represented as dark circles) for the first two consecutive pulses, whereas opposing needles 4 & 5 (represented as lightly shaded circles) were positive.  This pattern was repeated for the next two pulses
except the pattern was rotated one-needle clockwise.  This clockwise rotation preceded each set of two pulses and was repeated until 12 pulses were delivered.  This sequence was designed to treat 360.degree.  of the cell growth surface.
<BR><BR> Testing Conditions & Experimental Protocol:
<BR><BR> A hot water bath (Isotemp 105, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, N.H.) was used during the treatment of the cultures to maintain cell viability and was set at 50.degree.  C. A sheet of Plexiglas was cut to fit over the water bath and was used as a
surface for maintaining an approximate temperature of 37.degree.  C. All solutions used were allowed to reach room temperature (.about.22.degree.  C.) to prevent thermal shock to the cells.
<BR><BR> The absolute amplitude for the DC pulse generator (Transfector 800; BTX, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) ranged from 0 to 970 V. which corresponds to electric field intensities delivered between 0 to 1385 V/cm.  The pulse width was set within optimal
conditions at 99 .mu.sec (maximum).  Using short electrical pulses for cellular manipulation has the advantage of resulting in negligible thermal heating.
<BR><BR> Each set of treatment conditions was tested in triplicate wells.  Eighteen hours after seeding plates, each well was treated individually by aspirating the media, and quickly adding 150 .mu.l of solution.  This was just enough volume to coat the
bottom of the well.  For those conditions that required electric current, the electrode was placed down in the well so that the prongs set flush on the bottom to minimize any movement of the electrode (FIG. 4).  Electrical current was then applied in the
manner previously described.
<BR><BR> After application of the pulses, cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37.degree.  C. This time allowed membrane resealing before the cells were carefully washed with 500 .mu.l aliquots of PBS three times.  Liquid from each wash was carefully and
thoroughly aspirated.  Then, each well was filled with 500 .mu.l of PBS.
<BR><BR> The presence of delivered calcein was observed under the microscope with the aid of a fluorescence microscope.  A 0.9% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution was then used to lyse the cells after the completion of the washing.  SDS is a detergent
that dissolves hydrophobic molecules.  Therefore, when cells are incubated with an SDS solution, the membrane proteins and lipids denature and solubilize.  250 .mu.l of the SDS solution was added to each of the wells containing PBS to yield a final
concentration of 0.3%.
<BR><BR> The contents of each well were transferred to a 5 ml FACS tube (BD Falcon).  An additional 500 .mu.l of PBS was added to each tube to increase sample volume.  All samples were then centrifuged at 220.times.g for 5 minutes at 37.degree.  C.
<BR><BR> Fluorescence Measurement:
<BR><BR> Individual readings of each sample were taken using a fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer LS-3B, Oakbrook.  Ill.).  The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths for calcein were found to be 488 and 515, respectively.  The readings were
made in a 1 cm.sup.2 quartz cuvette, using a sample volume of 1 ml.
<BR><BR> Membrane Recovery:
<BR><BR> The membrane integrity of the cells after electroporation treatment is an essential factor for determining the applications in which this procedure will be utilized.  It is typically desired to preserve, as much as possible, the original
cellular structures of these living membranes in order to obtain optimal post-treatment results.  As mentioned earlier, cellular membranes can undergo REB in which the biological structures will eventually return to their normal state.  Twenty four hours
post-treatment, the fate of the cells can typically he determined.  For the purpose of this study, optimal testing conditions were used to treat B16F10 cells to conclude the extent of reversible permeation.
<BR><BR> Due to the large surface area of the wells, the cells were physically counted by observing 7 out of 21 fields of view along the horizontal diameter of each well at a magnification of 400.times.  (see FIG. 5).  The recovery of the membranes after
exposure to each treating condition was expressed as a percentage of live cells remaining after each hour.
<BR><BR> In order to distinguish the viable cells from the dead, a 0.4% trypan blue solution in PBS was used.  150 .mu.l of the solution was added to each well for 1 minute, and then the cells were counted using the described method.  Each test condition
was studied at 1 hour intervals ranging from 1 hour to 4 hours.  In addition, membrane recovery was examined 24 hours post treatment.
<BR><BR> pH Measurements:
<BR><BR> The three concentrations of ASA, SA, and AA had pH values that were determined.  The pH measurements were made using a pH meter (Colloidal Dynamics, AZR2, Sydney, Australia), which was calibrated using 3 solutions with known pH values.  The pH
values of each solution were 4.7, and 10.
<BR><BR> Statistical Methods:
<BR><BR> To determine the statistical relevance of the data, a criterion for considering the mean data of one treatment condition as more successful than another had to be established.  The null hypothesis used was that no change took place when
considering one set of treatment parameters over another, and the alternative hypothesis used was that a significant change took place that resulted in different mean fluorescence values.  The method used to test the null hypothesis was a two-tailed
paired sample t test, with a level of significance of .alpha.=0.05.  If the computed t-score was in between the critical values, then the null hypothesis would be accepted, whereas if the t-score was a value that lied outside of the critical value
parameters, there would be significant evidence to allow for a conclusion that the treatments differed in their effectiveness.
