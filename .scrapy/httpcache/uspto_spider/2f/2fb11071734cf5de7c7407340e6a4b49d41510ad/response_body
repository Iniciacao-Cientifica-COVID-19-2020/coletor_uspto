       <FONT size="+1"> Cyclic compounds useful as inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA
</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p>This invention relates to novel cyclic compounds containing carbocyclic
     ring systems useful as antagonists of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
     complex, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such cyclic compounds,
     with or without other therapeutic agents, and to methods of using these
     compounds, with or without other therapeutic agents, for the inhibition of
     platelet aggregation, as thrombolytics, and/or for the treatment of other
     thromboembolic disorders. This invention also relates to methods of using
     the cyclic compounds of the invention in combination with anti-coagulants
     such as warfarin or heparin, or additional anti-platelet agents such as
     <B><I>aspirin,</I></B> piroxicam or ticlopidine, or thrombin inhibitors such as
     boropeptides, hirudin or argatroban, or thrombolytic agents such as tissue
     plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or
     combinations thereof, for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders. A
     representative compound of the invention is cyclo(D-Val-(.sup..alpha.
     N-methyl Arg)-Gly-Asp-(3-aminomethylbenzoic acid).

<BR><BR>This invention relates to novel cyclic compounds containing carbocyclic ring systems useful as antagonists of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such cyclic compounds, with or without other
therapeutic agents, and to methods of using these compounds, with or without other therapeutic agents, for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, as thrombolytics, and/or for the treatment of other thromboembolic disorders.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Activation of platelets and the resulting platelet aggregation and secretion of factors by the platelets has been associated with different pathophysiological conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboembolic disorders, for
example, the thromboembolic disorders associated with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis and diabetes.  The contribution of platelets to these disease processes stems from their ability to form
aggregates, or platelet thrombi, especially in the arterial wall following injury or plaque rupture.
<BR><BR>Platelets are known to play an essential role in the maintenance of hemostasis and in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis.  Platelet activation has been shown to be enhanced during coronary thrombolysis which can lead to delayed reperfusion
and reocclusion.  Clinical studies with aspirin, ticlopidine and a monoclonal antibody for platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa provide biochemical evidence for platelet involvement in unstable angina, early stage of acute myocardial infarction, transient
ischemic attack, cerebral ischemia, and stroke.
<BR><BR>Platelets are activated by a wide variety of agonists resulting in platelet shape change, secretion of granular contents and aggregation.  Aggregation of platelets serves to further focus clot formation by concentrating activated clotting factors
in one site.  Several endogenous agonists including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and collagen, have been identified.  Because of the involvement of several endogenous agonists in activating platelet function and
aggregation, an inhibitor which acts against all agonists would represent a more efficacious antiplatelet agent than currently available antiplatelet drugs, which are agonist-specific.
<BR><BR>Current antiplatelet drugs are effective against only one type of agonist; these include aspirin, which acts against arachidonic acid; ticlopidine, which acts against ADP; thromboxane A.sub.2 synthetase inhibitors or receptor antagonists, which
act against thromboxane A.sub.2 ; and hirudin, which acts against thrombin.
<BR><BR>Recently, a common pathway for all known agonists has been identified, namely platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex (GPIIb/IIIa), which is the membrane protein mediating platelet aggregation.  A recent review of GPIIb/IIIa is provided by
Phillips et al. (1991) Cell 65: 359-362.  The development of a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist represents a promising new approach for antiplatelet therapy.  Recent studies in man with a monoclonal antibody for GPIIb/IIIa indicate the antithrombotic benefit of a
GPIIb/IIIa antagonist.
<BR><BR>There is presently a need for a GPIIb/IIIa-specific antiplatelet agent which inhibits the activation and aggregation of platelets in response to any agonist.  Such an agent should represent a more efficacious antiplatelet therapy than the
currently available agonist-specific platelet inhibitors.
<BR><BR>GPIIb/IIIa does not bind soluble proteins on unstimulated platelets, but GPIIb/IIIa in activated platelets is known to bind four soluble adhesive proteins, namely fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin.  The binding of
fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor to GPIIb/IIIa causes platelets to aggregate.  The binding of fibrinogen is mediated in part by the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition sequence which is common to the adhesive proteins that bind GPIIb/IIIa.
<BR><BR>Several RGD-containing peptides and related compounds have been reported which block fibrinogen binding and prevent the formation of platelet thrombi.  For example, see Cadroy et al. (1989) J. Clin. Invest.  84: 939-944; Klein et al. U.S.  Pat. 
No. 4,952,562, issued Aug.  28, 1990; European Patent Application EP 0319506 A; European Patent Application EP 0422938 A1; European Patent Application EP 0422937 A1; European Patent Application EP 0341915 A2; PCT Patent Application WO 89/07609; PCT
Patent Application WO 90/02751; PCT Patent Application WO 91/04247; and European Patent Application EP 0343085 A1.
<BR><BR>In the present invention we use conformationally-constraining carbocyclic ring systems as templates for cyclizing peptides such that they have high affinity and selectivity for GPIIb/IIIa.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>This invention provides novel cyclic compounds containing carbocyclic ring systems useful as antagonists of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, pharmaceutical compositions containing such cyclic compounds, and methods of using these
compounds for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, as thrombolytics, and/or for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders.
<BR><BR>This invention also relates to combination products, that is, pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel cyclic compounds of the invention in combination with anti-coagulants such as warfarin or heparin, or anti-platelet agents such as
aspirin, piroxicam or ticlopidine, or thrombin inhibitors such as boropeptides, hirudin or argatroban, or thrombolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof, to pharmaceutical kits
containing these combination products, and to methods of using these combination products for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, as thrombolytics, and/or for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
<BR><BR>FIG. I. FIG. I shows the platelet deaggregatory and thrombolytic effects of the cyclic IIb/IIIa antagonist compounds cyclo-(D-AbuNMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound A) and cyclo-(D-Val-NMeArgGly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound B) at varying concentrations on an
already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  The cyclic compounds of the present invention had a significant lytic effect on the clot, with an IC.sub.50 of about 0.0005 mM for Compound
A. By comparison, the linear peptide RGDS was much less effective as a thrombolytic, even at substantially higher concentrations.
<BR><BR>FIG. II.  FIG. II shows the thrombolytic effect of the cyclic IIb/IIIa antagonist compounds cyclo-(D-AbuNMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound A) and cyclo-(D-Val-NMeArgGly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound B), and the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA), urokinase (UK) and streptokinase (SK) on an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  Both Compounds A and B showed a significant thrombolytic effect as compared to
the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, and streptokinase.
<BR><BR>FIG. III FIG. III shows the thrombolytic effect of the cyclic compound cyclo-(D-AbuNMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound A) and the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase (UK), and streptokinase (SK), both alone and in
combination, on an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  Compound A showed a significant thrombolytic effect, providing significant clot lysis at 1.0 uM.  Moreover, Compound A
in combination with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or streptokinase was significantly better than Compound A alone, and significantly better than the additive effects of both agents administered alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. IV.  FIG. IV shows the thrombolytic effect of the cyclic IIb/IIIa antagonist compound cyclo-(D-Val-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound B) and the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase (UK) and streptokinase (SK),
both alone and in combination, on an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  Compound B showed a significant thrombolytic effect, providing significantly better clot lysis than
tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase.  Moreover, Compound B in combination with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase was significantly better than Compound B alone, and significantly better than the additive
effects of both agents.
<BR><BR>FIG. V. FIG. V shows the thrombolytic effect of the cyclic compound cyclo-(DVal-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-MeMamb) (isomer 1; the compound of Example 68) (Compound C) alone and in combination with the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA), urokinase (UK) and streptokinase (SK) on an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  Compound C alone showed a significant thrombolytic effect.  In combination with tissue
plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase, a thrombolytic effect was achieved which was greater than the additive effect of the agents when administered alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. VI.  FIG. VI shows the thrombolytic effect of the cyclic compound cyclo-(D-Val-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-MeMamb) MeMamb) (isomer 2; the compound of Example 68a) (Compound D) alone and in combination with the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA), urokinase (UK) and streptokinase (SK) on an already formed plateletrich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating the platelets with agonists for 30 minutes.  Compound D alone showed a significant thrombolytic effect.  In combination with
tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase, a thrombolytic effect was achieved which was greater than the additive effect of the agents when administered alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. VII.  FIG. VII shows the in vivo thrombolytic and anti-thrombotic effect of the cyclic glycoprotein IIb/IIIa compound cyclo-(D-Abu-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb) (Compound A), alone or in combination with the standard thrombolytic streptokinase (SK). 
The experiments were carried out using an arterial thrombosis animal model.  FIG. VII shows the results of initial administration as a percentage of clot lysis.  Compound A alone showed good in vivo thrombolytic efficacy, and the use of Compound A with
streptokinase resulted in an increase in in vivo thrombolytic efficacy while allowing a significantly lower dose of streptokinase.  This study demonstrated significant reduction in the dose of streptokinase required to achieve 100% lysis in vivo when
Compound A is administered along with streptokinase.
<BR><BR>FIG. VIII.  FIG. VIII a-d shows the results of administration of Compound A or saline following streptokinase (SK) or tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) thrombolysis, with the results reported as time to reocclusion and percentage of
reocclusion.  The saline control showed 100% reocclusion, whereas administration of Compound A resulted in virtually no reocclusion. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

<BR><BR>In the present invention it has been discovered that the compounds above are useful as inhibitors of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa).  As discussed above, GPIIb/IIIa mediates the process of platelet activation and aggregation.  The compounds
of the present invention inhibit the activation and aggregation of platelets induced by all known endogenous platelet agonists.
<BR><BR>The present invention also provides methods for the treatment (including prevention) of conditions involving platelet activation and aggregation, such as arterial or venous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular thromboembolic disorders, including,
for example, thromboembolic disorders associated with unstable angina, first or recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or diabetes, by
administering to a host in need of such treatment a pharmaceutically effective amount of the compounds described above.  The compounds of the present invention are useful for inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen to blood platelets, inhibiting aggregation
of blood platelets, treating thrombus formation or embolus formation, or preventing thrombus or embolus formation in a mammal.  The compounds of the invention may be used as a medicament for blocking fibrinogen from acting at its receptor site in a
mammal.
<BR><BR>The compounds of the present invention can also be combined or co-administered with suitable anti-coagulant or coagulation inhibitory agents, such as heparin or warfarin, or anti-platelet or platelet inhibitory agents, such as aspirin, piroxicam
or ticlopidine.  Further, the compounds of this invention may be combined or co-administered with thrombin inhibitors such as boropeptides, hirudin or argatroban.  The compounds of the present invention may also be combined or co-administered with
thrombolytic or fibrinolytic agents, such as plasminogen activators, anistreplase, urokinase, or streptokinase.  The compounds of the present invention may also be combined or co-administered with combinations of the foregoing agents and/or with other
therapeutic agents.  Such combination products may be employed to achieve synergistic effects or effects additive to those provided by the compounds of the present invention, such as, for example, in such uses as described above, particularly in the
treatment, including prevention, of thromboembolic disorders.
<BR><BR>The GPIIb/IIIa antagonists of the present invention inhibit platelet aggregation at the final common pathway required for platelet aggregation induced by any of the known platelet activators or even their combinations.  On the other hand,
platelet granular secretions, of various important biomolecules from the .alpha.-granule (PAI-1) or the dense granule (serotonin) are not affected by the GPIIb/IIIa antagonist.  These molecules secreted from platelets might play an important role in
arterial vasospasm (serotonin) and in reducing the efficiency of the natural lytics (PAI-1).  Hence, the combination of the compounds of the present invention with other drugs which may affect these mechanisms and may thereby provide a particularly
effective therapy for many different heterogenous thromboembolic disorders.
<BR><BR>The GPIIb/IIIa antagonists of the present invention with high affinity for the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor (Kd&lt;0.01 .mu.M) are expected to be very effective not only in preventing thrombosis formation, but also in accelerating lysis of
platelet rich thrombi, thereby providing a greater utility of such antiplatelet agents in the acute and chronic thromboembolic disorders.  Such a strategy may be an effective adjunct therapy with thrombolytic therapy.  Indeed, platelet activation after
thrombolytic therapy may have a significant role in the delay of reperfusion and abrupt closure (reocclusion).
<BR><BR>The term anti-coagulant agents (or coagulation inhibitory agents), as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit blood coagulation.  Such agents include warfarin, heparin, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), including pharmaceutically
acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.  For reasons of efficacy, the preferable anti-coagulant agents are warfarin or heparin or LMWH.  The warfarin employed herein, may be, for example, crystalline warfarin or amorphous sodium warfarin.  The heparin
employed herein may be, for example, the sodium or sulfate salts thereof.
<BR><BR>The term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function such as by inhibiting the aggregation, adhesion or granular secretion of platelets.  Such agents include the various
known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, and piroxicam, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.  Of the
NSAIDS, aspirin (acetylsalicyclic acid or ASA), which has been well researched and widely used with good results, and piroxicam, which exerts its anti-platelet effect when dosed once daily, are preferred compounds, especially aspirin.  Piroxicam is
commercially available from Pfizer Inc.  (New York, NY), as FELDANE.TM..  Other suitable anti-platelet agents include ticlopidine, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.  Ticlopidine is also a preferred compound since it is
known to be gentle on the gastro-intestinal tract in use.  Still other suitable platelet inhibitory agents include thromboxane-A2-receptor antagonists and thromboxane-A2-synthetase inhibitors, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs
thereof.
<BR><BR>The phrase thrombin inhibitors (or anti-thrombin agents), as used herein, denotes inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin.  By inhibiting thrombin, various thrombinmediated processes, such as thrombin-mediated platelet activation (that is, for
example, the aggregation of platelets, and/or the granular secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and/or serotonin) and/or fibrin formation are disrupted.  Such inhibitors include boropeptides, hirudin and argatroban, including pharmaceutically
acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.  Preferably the thrombin inhibitors are boropeptides.  By boropeptides, it is meant, N-acetyl and peptide derivatives of boronic acid, such as C-terminal .alpha.-aminoboronic acid derivatives of lysine, ornithine,
arginine, homoarginine and corresponding isothiouronium analogs thereof.  The term hirudin, as used herein, includes suitable derivatives or analogs of hirudin, referred to herein as hirulogs, such as disulfatohirudin.
<BR><BR>Preferable boropeptide thrombin inhibitors include compounds described in Kettner et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,187,157 and European Patent Application Publication Number 293 881 A2, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by
reference.  Other suitable boropeptide thrombin inhibitors include those disclosed in PCT Application Publication Number 92/07869 and European Patent Application Publication Number 471 651 A2, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by
reference, in their entirety.
<BR><BR>The phrase thrombolytics (or fibrinolytic) agents (or thrombolytics or fibrinolytics), as used herein, denotes agents that lyse blood clots (thrombi).  Such agents include tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase,
including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.  Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is commercially available from Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.  The term anistreplase, as used herein, refers to anisoylated plasminogen
streptokinase activator complex, as described, for example, in European Patent Application No. 0 28 489, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference herein, in their entirety.  Anistreplase is commercially available from the
Beecham Group, Middlesex, England, under the trademark EMINASE.TM..  The term urokinase, as used herein, is intended to denote both dual and single chain urokinase, the latter also being referred to herein as prourokinase.
<BR><BR>Combination products, where the cyclic compounds of the invention are combined or co-administered with suitable anti-coagulant agents, antiplatelet agents, thrombin inhibitors, and/or thrombolytic agents, may afford an efficacy advantage over the
compounds and agents alone, and may do so while permitting the use of lower doses of each.  A lower dosage minimizes the potential of side effects, thereby providing an increased margin of safety.
<BR><BR>Clinical studies using anti-coagulant agents alone, including crystalline sodium warfarin, have provided evidence of their efficacy in the treatment or secondary prevention of coronary artery disease.  Of three published, randomized, controlled
trials of the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, oral anti-coagulants significantly reduced overall mortality and the frequency of reinfarction in one study.  Of the four published large, randomized, controlled trials of oral anti-coagulants in
the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, three suggested a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction and early mortality.  One additional study, the Warfarin Reinfarction Study, has also recently demonstrated a significant reduction in
mortality, reinfarction, and stroke in people with a previous myocardial infarction who were treated with warfarin as compared to those treated with placebo.
<BR><BR>The results of studies utilizing anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease have also been promising.  In patients with unstable angina, ASA has been demonstrated to
reduce the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction and mortality in two large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.  In addition, ASA has been approved for use in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, based on
data from several trials which, when pooled, suggested a reduction in reinfarction and mortality.  Furthermore, two recent studies evaluating ASA in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease have reported either a dramatic or inconsequential
benefit.  In addition to their utility in coronary artery disease, agents that inhibit platelet function such as ASA and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective in the prevention of stroke in people with cerebrovascular disease.  Pooled data from
nine randomized trials have provided overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of ASA alone in reducing the risk of completed stroke in people with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).  Recently, ticlopidine alone has also been demonstrated to have efficacy in
treating TIAs.
<BR><BR>With regard to thrombin inhibitors, such as boropeptides, studies have demonstrated that such compounds provide excellent candidates for the control of thrombinmediated processes.  Studies with hirudin, another thrombin inhibitor, have shown this
agent to be an effective compound in the treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis.
<BR><BR>Current therapy in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction includes thrombolytics such as plasminogen activators such as tPA, streptokinase, or urokinase.  These standard thrombolytics, when employed alone, promote the
generation of plasmin, which degrades platelet-rich fibrin clots.
<BR><BR>Thromboembolic disorders are known, however, to have a diverse pathophysiological makeup.  There is a need for a therapeutic approach to the treatment of these disorders which takes into account the diverse pathophysiological makeup of such
diseases, and which includes components ameliorating each of the various pathophysiological aspects.  A combination product containing an anti-coagulant agent such as warfarin or heparin, or an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin, piroxicam or
ticlopidine, or a thrombin inhibitor such as a boropeptide, hirudin or argatroban, or a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof, in combination with a novel cyclic
compound of the invention, can provide such an approach.  In addition, by administering lower doses of each, which is feasible where an additive or synergistic effect is involved, the incidence of any side effects associated with each alone at higher
doses may be significantly reduced.  Also, where a convenient single dosage form is offered, as in a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is generally accepted that such increased convenience to the patient results in an increase in compliance. 
Also, a single dosage form would reduce the likelihood of patient confusion often associated with concurrent dosing of medication not available in a single dosage form.  The present combinations of an anticoagulant agent and a compound of this invention,
or an anti-platelet agent and a compound of this invention, or a thrombin inhibitor and a compound of this invention, or a thrombolytic agent and a compound of this invention, or combinations thereof, are directed to meeting these, as well as other,
needs.
<BR><BR>GPIIb/IIIa is known to be overexpressed in metastatic tumor cells.  The compounds or combination products of the present invention may also be useful for the treatment, including prevention, of metastatic cancer.
<BR><BR>The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers.  Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral, diastereomeric and racemic forms are included in the present invention.  Many geometric isomers of olefins, C.dbd.N double bonds, and the like
can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  It will be appreciated that compounds of the present invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be
isolated in optically active or racemic forms.  It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis, from optically active starting materials.  Two distinct isomers (cis and trans) of
the peptide bond are known to occur; both can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  Unless otherwise specifically noted, the L-isomer of the amino acid is used at
positions J, K, L, and M of the compounds of the present invention.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry
or isomer form is specifically indicated.  The D and L-isomers of a particular amino acid are designated herein using the conventional 3-letter abbreviation of the amino acid, as indicated by the following examples: D-Leu, D-Leu, L-Leu, or L-Leu.
<BR><BR>When any variable (for example, R.sup.1 through R.sup.8, m, n, p, X, Y, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.  Thus, for
example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R.sup.11, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R.sup.11 and R.sup.11 at each occurrence is selected independently from the defined list of possible R.sup.11.  Also, by way of
example, for the group --N(R.sup.13).sub.2, each of the two R.sup.13 substituents on N is independently selected from the defined list of possible R.sup.13.
<BR><BR>When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross the bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring.

branched configuration and one or more unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds which may occur in any stable point along the chain, such as ethenyl, propenyl and the like; and "alkynyl" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either a straight or branched
configuration and one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds which may occur in any stable point along the chain, such as ethynyl, propynyl and the like.

can alternatively be taken together to form: a cyclic boron ester where said chain or ring contains from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and, optionally, 1-4 heteroatoms independently selected from N, S, or O, a divalent cyclic boron amide where said chain or ring
contains from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and, optionally, 1-4 heteroatoms independently selected from N, S, or O, a cyclic boron amide-ester where said chain or ring contains from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and, optionally, 1-4 heteroatoms independently selected
from N, S, or O. Such cyclic boron esters, boron amides, or boron amide-esters may also be optionally substituted with 1-5 groups independently selected from R.sup.11.
<BR><BR>Boron esters include boronic acid protecting groups, including moieties derived from diols, for example pinanediol and pinacol to form pinanediol boronic acid ester and the pinacol boronic acid, respectively.  Other illustrations of diols useful
for deriving boronic acid esters are perfluoropinacol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 2,3-hexanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, catechol,

<BR><BR>Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the .alpha.-amine of the C-terminal residue and coupling the next suitably protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described.  This deprotection and coupling procedure is
repeated until the desired sequence is obtained.  This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in a stepwise fashion, or condensation of fragments (two to several amino acids), or combination of both processes, or by solid phase
peptide synthesis according to the method originally described by Merrifield, J. Am.  Chem. Soc., 85, 2149-2154 (1963), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>The compounds of the invention may also be synthesized using automated peptide synthesizing equipment.  In addition to the foregoing, procedures for peptide synthesis are described in Stewart and Young, "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", 2nd ed,
Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.  (1984); Gross, Meienhofer, Udenfriend, Eds., "The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, Academic Press, New York, (1980-1987); Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry: A Practical Textbook",
Springer-Verlag, New York (1988); and Bodanszky et al. "The Practice of Peptide Sythesis" Springer-Verlag, New York (1984), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>The coupling between two amino acid derivatives, an amino acid and a peptide, two peptide fragments, or the cyclization of a peptide can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic acid anhydride
(isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimides) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K method,
carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents such as BOP-Cl, or oxidation-reduction method.  Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide) can be enhanced by the addition of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole.  These coupling reactions may be performed in
either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.
<BR><BR>The functional groups of the constituent amino acids must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid undesired bonds being formed.  The protecting groups that can be used are listed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis"
John Wiley & Sons, New York (1981) and "The Peptides: Analysis, Sythesis, Biology, Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>The .alpha.-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected by an ester that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid.  These protecting groups include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl and t-butyl, 2) aryl esters such as benzyl and
substituted benzyl, or 3) esters which can be cleaved by mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.  In the solid phase case, the C-terminal amino acid is attached to an insoluble carrier (usually
polystyrene).  These insoluble carriers contain a group which will react with the carboxyl group to form a bond which is stable to the elongation conditions but readily cleaved later.  Examples of which are: oxime resin (DeGrado and Kaiser (1980) J. Org.
Chem. 45, 1295-1300) chloro or bromomethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, and aminomethyl resin.  Many of these resins are commercially available with the desired C-terminal amino acid already incorporated.
<BR><BR>The .alpha.-amino group of each amino acid must be protected.  Any protecting group known in the art can be used.  Examples of these are: 1) acyl types such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate types
such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, 1-(p-biphenyl)-1-methylethoxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate types such as tert-butloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl,
diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alkyl carbamate types such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6) trialkylsilane such as trimethylsilane; and 7) thiol
containing types such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl.  The preferred .alpha.-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc.  Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available.
<BR><BR>The .alpha.-amino protecting group is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid.  When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane.  The resulting ammonium salt
is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or dimethylformamide.  When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted
piperidines in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine or aqueous basic solutions can be used.  The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0.degree.  C. and room temperature.
<BR><BR>Any of the amino acids bearing side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-identified groups.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate
protecting groups for these side chain functionalities will depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide.  The selection of such a protecting group is important in that it must not be removed during the deprotection
and coupling of the .alpha.-amino group.
<BR><BR>For example, when Boc is chosen for the .alpha.-amine protection the following protecting groups are acceptable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties ahd nitro for arginine; benzyloxycarbonyl, substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, or tosyl for lysine;
benzyl or alkyl esters such as cyclopentyl for glutamic and aspartic acids; benzyl ethers for serine and threonine; benzyl ethers, substituted benzyl ethers or 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl for tyrosine; p-methylbenzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, acetamidomethyl,
benzyl, or t-butylsulfonyl for cysteine; and the indole of tryptophan can either be left unprotected or protected with a formyl group.
<BR><BR>When Fmoc is chosen for the .alpha.-amine protection usually tert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable.  For instance, Boc can be used for lysine, tert-butyl ether for serine, threonine and tyrosine, and tert-butyl ester for glutamic and
aspartic acids.
<BR><BR>Once the elongation and cyclization of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed.  For the liquid phase synthesis the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner as dictated by the choice of protecting groups.  These
procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.
<BR><BR>When a solid phase synthesis is used, the peptide should be removed from the resin without simultaneously removing protecting groups from functional groups that might interfere with the cyclization process.  Thus, if the peptide is to be cyclized
in solution, the cleavage conditions need to be chosen such that a free .alpha.-carboxylate and a free .alpha.-amino group are generated without simultaneously removing other protecting groups.  Alternatively, the peptide may be removed from the resin by
hydrazinolysis, and then coupled by the azide method.  Another very convenient method involves the synthesis of peptides on an oxime resin, followed by intramolecular nucleophilic displacement from the resin, which generates a cyclic peptide (Osapay,
Profit, and Taylor (1990) Tetrahedron Letters 43, 6121-6124).  When the oxime resin is employed, the Boc protection scheme is generally chosen.  Then, the preferred method for removing side chain protecting groups generally involves treatment with
anhydrous HF containing additives such as dimethyl sulfide, anisole, thioanisole, or p-cresol at 0.degree.  C. The cleavage of the peptide can also be accomplished by other acid reagents such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid/trifluoroacetic acid
mixtures.
<BR><BR>Unusual amino acids used in this invention can be synthesized by standard methods familiar to those skilled in the art ("The Peptides: Analysis, Sythesis, Biology, Vol. 5, pp.  342-449, Academic Press, New York (1981)).  N-Alkyl amino acids can
be prepared using procedures described in previously (Cheung et al., (1977) Can.  J. Chem. 55, 906; Freidinger et al., (1982) J. Org. Chem. 48, 77 (1982)), which are incorporated here by reference.

<BR><BR>Synthesis of Cyclic Peptides
<BR><BR>t-Butyloxycarbonyl-3-aminomethylbenzoic acid (Boc-Mamb) is coupled to oxime resin by a modification of the method described by DeGrado and Kaiser (1980) J. Org. Chem. 45, 1295 using 1 equivalent of the 3-aminomethylbenzoic acid (with respect to
the substitution level of the resin), 1 equivalent of HBTU, and 3 equivalent of NMM.  Alternatively, Boc-Mamb (1 equivalent) may be coupled to the oxime resin using 1 equivalent each of DCC and DMAP in methylene chloride.  Coupling times range from 15 to
96 hours.  The substitution level is then determined using either the picric acid test (Satin, Kent, Tam, and Merrifield, (1981) Anal. Biochem.  117, 145-157) or the quantitative ninhydrin assay (Gisin (1972) Anal. Chim.  Acta 58, 248-249).  Unreacted
oxime groups are blocked using 0.5M trimethylacetylchloride/0.5M diisopropylethylamine in DMF for 2 hours.  Deprotection of the Boc protecting group is accomplished using 25% TFA in DCM for 30 minutes.  The remaining amino acids or amino acid derivatives
are coupled using between a two and ten fold excess (based on the loading of the first amino acid or amino acid derivative) of the appropriate amino acid or amino acid derivatives and HBTU in approximately 8 ml of DMF.  The resin is then neutralized in
situ using 3 eq.  of NMM (based on the amount of amino acid used) and the coupling times range from 1 hour to several days.  The completeness of coupling is monitored by qualitative ninhydrin assay, or picric acid assay in cases where the amino acid was
coupled to a secondary amine.  Amino acids are recoupled if necessary based on these results.
<BR><BR>After the linear peptide had been assembled, the N-terminal Boc group is removed by treatment with 25% TFA in DCM for 30 minutes.  The resin is then neutralized by treatment with 10% DIEA in DCM.  Cyclization with concomitant cleavage of the
peptide is accomplished using the method of Osapay and Taylor ((1990) J. Am.  Chem. Soc., 112, 6046) by suspending the resin in approximately 10 ml/g of DMF, adding one equivalent of HOAc (based on the loading of the first amino acid), and stirring at
50.degree.-60.degree.  C. for 60 to 72 hours.  Following filtration through a scintered glass funnel, the DMF filtrate is evaporated, redissolved in HO Ac or 1:1 acetonitrile: H.sub.2 O , and lyophilized to obtain protected, cyclized material. 
Alternatively, the material may be dissolved in methanol and precipitated with ether to obtain the protected, cyclized material.  This is then treated using standard procedures with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (Stewart and Young (1984) "Solid Phase

<BR><BR>Utility
<BR><BR>The compounds of this invention possess antiplatelet efficacy, as evidenced by their activity in standard platelet aggregation assays or platelet fibrinogen binding assays, as described below.  A compound is considered to be active in these
assays if it has an IC.sub.50 value of less than about 1 mM.  Platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding assays which may used to demonstrate the antiplatelet activity of the compounds of the invention are described below.
<BR><BR>Platelet Aggregation Assay: Venous blood was obtained from the arm of a healthy human donor who was drug-free and aspirin-free for at least two weeks prior to blood collection.  Blood was collected into 10 ml citrated Vacutainer tubes.  The blood
was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 150.times.g at room temperature, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was removed.  The remaining blood was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1500.times.g at room temperature, and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was removed.  Samples
were assayed on a aggregometer (PAP-4 Platelet Aggregation Profiler), using PPP as the blank (100% transmittance).  200 .mu.l of PRP was added to each micro test tube, and transmittance was set to 0%.  20 .mu.l of various agonists (ADP, collagen,
arachidonate, epinephrine, thrombin) were added to each tube, and the aggregation profiles were plotted (% transmittance versus time).  The results were expressed as % inhibition of agonist-induced platelet aggregation.  For the IC.sub.50 evaluation, the
test compounds were added at various concentrations prior to the activation of the platelets.
<BR><BR>Platelet-Fibrinogen Binding Assay: Binding of .sup.125 I-fibrinogen to platelets was performed as described by Bennett et al. (1983) Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA 80: 2417-2422, with some modifications as described below.  Human PRP (h-PRP) was
applied to a Sepharose column for the purification of platelet fractions.  Aliquots of platelets (5.times.10.sup.8 cells) along with 1 mM calcium chloride were added to removable 96 well plates prior to the activation of the human gel purified platelets
(h-GPP).  Activation of the human gel purified platelets was achieved using ADP, collagen, arachidonate, epinephrine, and/or thrombin in the presence of the ligand, .sup.125 I-fibrinogen.  The .sup.125 I-fibrinogen bound to the activated, platelets was
separated from the free form by centrifugation and then counted on a gamma counter.  For an IC.sub.50 evaluation, the test compounds were added at various concentrations prior to the activation of the platelets.
<BR><BR>The novel cyclic glycoprotein IIb/IIIa compounds of the invention also possess thrombolytic efficacy, that is, they are capable of lysing (breaking up) already formed platelet-rich fibrin blood clots, and thus are useful in treating a thrombus
formation, as evidenced by their activity in the tests described below.  Preferred cyclic compounds of the present invention for use in thrombolysis include those compounds having an IC.sub.50 value (that is, the molar concentration of the cyclic
compound capable of achieving 50% clot lysis) of less than about 1 mM, more preferably an IC.sub.50 value of less than about 0.1 mM, even more preferably an IC.sub.50 value of less than about 0.01 mM, still more preferably an IC.sub.50 value of less than
about 0.001 mM, and most preferably an IC.sub.50 value of about 0.0005 mM.
<BR><BR>IC.sub.50 determinations may be made using a standard thrombolysis assay, as described below.  Another class of preferred thrombolytic compounds of the invention include those compounds which have a Kd of &lt;100 nM, preferably &lt;10 nM, most
preferably 0.1 to 1.0 nM.
<BR><BR>Thrombolytic Assay: Venous blood was obtained from the arm of a healthy human donor who was drug-free and aspirin free for at least two weeks prior to blood collection, and placed into 10 ml citrated Vacutainer tubes.  The blood was centrifuged
for 15 minutes at 1500 .times.g at room temperature, and platelet rich plasma (PRP) was removed.  To the PRP was then added 1.times.10.sup.- 3M of the agonist ADP, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonate, serotonin or thrombin, or a mixture thereof, and the
PRP incubated for 30 minutes.  The PRP was centrifuged for 12 minutes at 2500.times.g at room temperature.  The supernatant was then poured off, and the platelets remaining in the test tube were resuspended in platelet poor plasma (PPP), which served as
a plasminogen source.  The suspension was then assayed on a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, Fla.), to determine the platelet count at the zero time point.  After obtaining the zero time point, test compounds were added at various
concentrations.  Test samples were taken at various time points and the platelets were counted using the Coulter Counter.  To determine the percent of lysis, the platelet count at a time point subsequent to the addition of the test compound was
subtracted from the platelet count at the zero time point, and the resulting number divided by the platelet count at the zero time point.  Multiplying this result by 100 yielded the percentage of clot lysis achieved by the test compound.  For the
IC.sub.50 evaluation, the test compounds were added at various concentrations, and the percentage of lysis caused by the test compounds was calculated.
<BR><BR>Platelet Granular Secretion Studies.  The role of the claimed platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists on the modulation of platelet granular secretion from the .alpha.-granules, dense granules or intracellular Ca.sup.+2 binding proteins was
examined.  This class of compounds did not have any significant effect on platelet granular secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) from .alpha.-granules, the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores or the secretion of the
vasoconstrictor serotonin from the dense granules.  However, other antiplatelet agents such as aspirin or the antithrombin hirudin has been shown to inhibit platelet granular secretion of the antifibrinolytic (PAI-1) or the vasoconstrictor (serotonin)
Hence the combination between a universal antiaggregatory as well as an inhibitor of platelet secretion might provide optimal clinical benefits.
<BR><BR>The novel cyclic compounds of the invention are also useful in combination products, that is, in pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel cyclic compounds of the invention in combination with anti-coagulant agents such as warfarin or
heparin, or antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, piroxicam or ticlopidine, or thrombin inhibitors such as boropeptides, hirudin or argatroban, or thrombolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or
combinations thereof.  Such combination products possess anti-platelet and thrombolytic efficacy, as evidenced by their activity in the tests described below.
<BR><BR>These and other uses for the novel cyclic compounds of this invention, and combination products containing the same, will be readily apparent from the disclosures herein.
<BR><BR>Platelet GPIIb/IIIa Binding Affinity
<BR><BR>In the human gel-purified platelet (h-GPP) .sup.125 I-fibrinogen binding assay, representative compounds of the present invention demonstrated high affinity in inhibiting the .sup.125 I-fibrinogen binding to h-GPP (IC.sub.50 =5-100 nM) regardless
of the agonist used.  In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified GPIIb/IIIa receptors obtained from human platelets, the representative compounds of the invention demonstrated direct inhibition of fibrinogen binding to RGD recognition
site(s), with an IC.sub.50 of 0.5-10 nM.  The inhibitory efficacy of the presently claimed compounds on fibrinogen binding to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor was shown to be related to the number of binding sites, as is evident from the decrease in
IC.sub.50 when platelet number was decreased.
<BR><BR>Compound A (Example 3) was shown to displace .sup.125 I-fibrinogen bound to activated platelets In this study, fibrinogen bound to activated platelets was incubated for 20 minutes prior to the addition of Compound A. This suggests a high affinity
for Compound A in displacing fibrinogen from an already formed platelet-rich clot.  This effect may explain the lyric efficacy of the compounds of the present invention.  A high affinity binding (Kd=0.1 nM) of .sup.3 H-labeled Compound A to activated
human platelets was determined based on Scatchard analysis.  Additionally, in the purified GPIIb/IIIa-biotinylated fibrinogen ELISA, Compound A demonstrated competitive inhibitory efficacy with a K.sub.i of 0.4 nM based on Michaelis-Menten analysis.
<BR><BR>As shown below, in the human PRP aggregation assay, Compound A was shown not only to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by agonists, but also to deaggregate platelets after the initiation of aggregation.  The deaggregation efficacy of Compound
A was dependent on its concentration and the time of addition post-initiation of platelet activation.  The earlier the addition of Compound A after the induction of aggregation, the greater its deaggregatory efficacy (FIG. Ia).
<BR><BR>The effect of Compound A on the lysis of a pre-formed platelet-rich clot was also examined.  In this regard, the thrombolytic efficacy of Compound A was also evaluated (FIG. Ib and II).  Compounds A and B (Example 4) both demonstrated a
significant lyric efficacy of pre-formed platelet rich-clot (FIG. Ib).  Furthermore, Compound A demonstrated in vitro and in vivo synergistic efficacy with standard thrombolytics in lysing a platelet-rich thrombus (FIG. IIIb).  A concentration-dependent
lytic effect with an IC.sub.50 of 0.5-1.0 uM for compounds A and B was shown (FIG. Ib).  In contrast the tetrapeptide, RGDS, was shown to be ineffective under similar conditions (FIG. Ib).
<BR><BR>Additionally, in vitro studies revealed synergy between Compound A (0.1-1.0 uM) and streptokinase, urokinase or t-PA in lysing a pre-formed platelet-rich clot (FIG. III).  These results suggest an in vivo lytic potential for disclosed compounds
of the present invention.  Additionally, administration of these novel antagonists is expected to significantly reduce the dosage of a thrombolytic agent being used for clot lysis and the prevention of reocclusion and/or restenosis.  In this regard,
increasing evidence suggests that platelet activation after thrombolytic therapy might have a significant role in delaying reperfusion and abrupt closure.  Hence, the disclosed analogs might be an effective adjunct to thrombolytic therapy or angioplasty.
<BR><BR>The cyclic glycoprotein IIb/III antagonist compounds of this invention have also been shown to displace .sup.125 I-fibrinogen bound to activated platelets in a platelet-fibrinogen binding assay similar to the platelet-fibrinogen binding assay
previously described.  The results indicated that the compounds have a high affinity in displacing fibrinogen from an already formed platelet-rich clot.  Although not intending to be bound by any theory of operation, this result may help explain the
surprising thrombolytic efficacy possessed by compounds of the invention, as illustrated in the preceding examples.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1
<BR><BR>Representative cyclic compounds of the present invention, namely the compound of Example 3 (cyclo-(D-Abu-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb; the compound of formula (II) wherein R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are H, J is D-2-aminobutyric acid, K is
.alpha.-N-methylarginine, L is glycine, and M is aspartic acid) (designated here as Compound A) and the compound of Example 4 (cyclo-(D-Val-NMeArg-Gly-Asp-Mamb; the compound of formula (II) wherein R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are H, J is D-valine, K is
.alpha.-N-methyl-arginine, L is glycine, and M is aspartic acid) (designated here as Compound B) were then tested in the human PRP aggregation assay (FIG. Ia).  FIG. 1 shows the effect of 0.1 uM Compound on the reversal of the aggregatory response
(deaggregation) to 10 uM ADP when added at 1.5 min post-initiation of aggregation.
<BR><BR>In the human PRP aggregation assay, representative compounds of the present invention are shown not only to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by agonists, but also to deaggregate platelets after the initiation of aggregation (FIG. Ia).  The
deaggregation efficacy of compound A was dependent on its concentration and the time of addition post-initiation of platelet activation.  The earlier the addition of Compound A after the induction of aggregation, the greater its deaggregatory efficacy.
<BR><BR>Compounds A and B were also tested at varying concentrations using the thrombolytic assay described above (FIG. Ib).  FIG. Ib shows the lyric effect of Compound A and B on an already formed platelet rich clot.  The clot was formed by incubating
platelets with a mixture of agonists (TEAC mixture), which consists of thrombin (0.01 U/ml), epinephrine (250 uM), ADP (250 uM), and collagen (10 ug.ml), for 30 minutes.  As a comparison, a linear peptide of sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine
(RGDS) was also tested in the thrombolytic assay.  The results are shown in FIG. I. The compounds of the invention (Compounds A and B) demonstrated a significant effect on the lysis of an already formed platelet-rich clot.  As the results indicated,
Compounds A and B had IC.sub.50 values of about 0.5-1.0 uM.  By comparison, the RGDS linear peptide was much less effective, even at substantially higher concentrations (IC.sub.50 &gt;1 mM).
<BR><BR>FIG. II
<BR><BR>Compounds A and B was tested at a concentration of 0.001 mM using the thrombolytic assay described above, with platelet stimulation being carried out using 1.times.10.sup.- 3M concentration of ADP.  As a comparison, the standard thrombolytics
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 10 .mu.g/ml), urokinase (UK; 900 units/ml) and streptokinase (SK; 500 units/ml) were also tested in the thrombolytic assay.  The results are shown in FIG. II.  The compounds of the invention (Compounds A and B)
demonstrated a significant effect on the lysis of an already formed platelet-rich clot, with Compound A providing significantly better clot lysis than tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, and streptokinase, and Compound B providing significantly
better clot lysis than streptokinase.  As the results indicated, Compound A had an excellent lysis percentage of 70% or greater.
<BR><BR>FIG. III
<BR><BR>FIG. III shows the effect of 1 uM of Compound A on the lysis of an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by the addition of TEAC mixture (which consists of thrombin (0.01 U/ml), epinephrine (250 uM), ADP (250 uM), and collagen
(10 ug.ml)) for 30 minutes.  Compound A resulted in significant clot lysis by itself as compared to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 10 .mu.g/ml), urokinase (UK; 900 units/ml) and streptokinase (SK; 500 units/ml).  A synergy (greater than additive
effect between the standard thrombolytics and the IIb/IIIa antagonist Compound A was demonstrated.  Data represent mean.+-.SEM, n=3 in each group.
<BR><BR>FIG. V
<BR><BR>Compound C was tested at a concentration of 1 uM using the thrombolytic assay described above, both alone and in combination with the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 10 .mu.g/ml), urokinase (UK; 900 units/ml) and
streptokinase (SK; 500 units/ml).  As the results indicate, the combination of Compound C with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase gave a greater than additive effect than either agent alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. VI
<BR><BR>Compound D was tested at a concentration of 1 uM using the thrombolytic assay described above, both alone and in combination with the standard thrombolytics tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 10 .mu.g/ml), urokinase (UK; 900 units/ml) and
streptokinase (SK; 500 units/ml).  As the results indicate, the combination of Compound D with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase or streptokinase gave a greater than additive effect than either agent alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. VII
<BR><BR>VII a.
<BR><BR>Effect of 1 uM Compound A on the lysis of an already formed platelet-rich clot.  The clot was formed by the addition of TEAC mixture (which consists of thrombin [0.001 U/ml], epinephrine [250 uM], adenosine diphosphate [250 uM] and collagen [10
ug/ml] for 30 min. Compound A resulted in a significant clot lysis by itself as compared to SK (500 U/ml), UK (900 U/ml) or t-PA (10 ug/ml).  A synergistic effect between the standard thrombolytics and the IIb/IIIa antagonist Compound A was demonstrated. Data represent mean.+-.SEM, N=3 in each group.
<BR><BR>VII b.
<BR><BR>In vivo thrombolytic efficacy of Compound A and its interaction with standard thrombolytics: Compound A at 1 mg/kg I.V.  in the modified Lucchesi model resulted in significant lysis of an already formed thrombus in the femoral artery. 
Additionally, Compound A in combination with sub-optimum doses of the standard thrombolytic, streptokinase (75 KU) resulted in a significant synergistic effect in fully lysing the thrombus with subsequent restoration of flow, and the prevention of
reocclusion.  Data represent mean.+-.SEM.  n=3-6 in each group.
<BR><BR>FIG. VIII
<BR><BR>Effects of Compound A vs saline, when given to anesthetized canine (male or female mongrel dogs) at 1.0 mg/kg I.V., on the incidence of femoral artery reocclusion post-thrombolysis with streptokinase (250-300.times.1000 IU/kg) or t-PA.  Compound
A resulted in 100% prevention of reocclusion for a period &gt;240 minutes, in comparison to saline-treated animals which were shown to reocclude at 42.+-.10 min. Compound A (1.0 mg/kg, I.V.) resulted in % prevention of the incidence of reocclusion
post-thrombolysis with SK or t-PA.  Data represents mean .+-.SEM, n=6 in each group.
<BR><BR>Antiplatelet combination of the cyclic GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist of the present invention and aspirin and/or heparin.
<BR><BR>Methods: Twelve purpose bred mongrel dogs (8-15 months of age) of either sex weighing between 8-12 kg were anesthetized with thiamylal sodium (15 mg/kg, i.v.) and alpha-chloralose (100 ng/kg, i.v.) Dogs were placed on positive pressure
ventilation (15 mg/kg (a) 20 breaths/min).  The femoral artery and vein were dissected and cannulated for arterial blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, blood sampling, and intravenous injections.
<BR><BR>Treatment Groups:
<BR><BR>Group I (Saline): I.V.  bolus of saline.
<BR><BR>Group II (Aspirin): 10 mg/kg, po--30 min prior to blood sampling.
<BR><BR>Group III (Compound A): 0.08 mg/kg, I.V.  bolus.
<BR><BR>Group IV (Aspirin/Compound A) : Aspirin at 10 mg/kg, po--30 min prior to the administration of Compound A at 0.08 mg/kg, i.v.
<BR><BR>(a) Serial blood samples were withdrawn for ex vivo platelet aggregation and platelet counts.
<BR><BR>(b) Bleeding time (min) was monitored over time as well.
<BR><BR>(c) Plasma levels of Compound A were determined by an ELISA in all groups.
<BR><BR>Results: The Compound A/aspirin, Compound A/heparin, and Compound A/warfarin combinations demonstrated an improved antiplatelet efficacy as compared to Compound A alone.  This was achieved without any significant effects on bleeding time or
platelet counts.
<BR><BR>Dosage and Formulation
<BR><BR>The compounds of this invention can be administered by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), in the body of a mammal.  They can be administered by any conventional
means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents, such as a second antiplatelet agent such as aspirin, piroxicam, or ticlopidine which are agonist-specific, or
an anti-coagulant such as warfarin or heparin, or a thrombin inhibitor such as a boropeptide, hirudin or argatroban, or a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof.  The
compounds of the invention, or compounds of the invention in combination with other therapeutic agents, can be administered alone, but generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and
standard pharmaceutical practice.
<BR><BR>The dosage of the novel cyclic compounds of this invention administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the age,
health and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired.  A daily dosage of active ingredient can be expected to be about 0.01 to 10 milligrams per
kilogram of body weight.
<BR><BR>Dosage forms (compositions suitable for administration) contain from about 1 milligram to about 100 milligrams of active ingredient per unit.  In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of
about 0.5-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.
<BR><BR>The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions.  It can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid
dosage forms.
<BR><BR>Gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like.  Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets.  Both tablets and
capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours.  Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the
atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.
<BR><BR>Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance.
<BR><BR>In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions.  Solutions for parenteral
administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances.  Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined,
are suitable stabilizing agents.  Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA.  In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol.
<BR><BR>Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.
<BR><BR>Useful pharmaceutical dosage-forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows:
<BR><BR>Capsules
<BR><BR>A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two-piece hard gelatin capsules each with 100 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 150 milligrams of lactose, 50 milligrams of cellulose, and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate.
<BR><BR>Soft Gelatin Capsules
<BR><BR>A mixture of active ingredient in a digestable oil such as soybean oil, cottonseed oil or olive oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 100 milligrams of the
active ingredient.  The capsules are washed and dried.
<BR><BR>Tablets
<BR><BR>A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit was 100 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 275 milligrams of microcrystalline
cellulose, 11 milligrams of starch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose.  Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption.
<BR><BR>The combination products of this invention, such as the novel cyclic IIb/IIIa antagonist compounds of this invention in combination with an anti-coagulant agent such as warfarin or heparin, or an anti-platelet agent such as aspirin, piroxicam or
ticlopidine, or a thrombin inhibitor such as a boropeptide, hirudin or argatroban, or a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof, can be in any dosage form, such as those
described above, and can also be administered in various ways, as described above.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment, the combination products of the invention are formulated together, in a single dosage form (that is, combined together in one capsule, tablet, powder, or liquid, etc.).  When the combination products are not formulated
together in a single dosage form, the cyclic glycoprotein IIb/IIIa compounds of this invention and the anti-coagulant agent, anti-platelet agent, thrombin inhibitor, and/or thrombolytic agent may be administered at the same time (that is, together), or
in any order, for example the compounds of this invention are administered first, followed by administration of the anti-coagulant agent, anti-platelet agent, thrombin inhibitor, and/or thrombolytic agent.  When not administered at the same time,
preferably the administration of the compound of this invention and any anti-coagulant agent, anti-platelet agent, thrombin inhibitor, and/or thrombolytic agent occurs less than about one hour apart, more preferably less than about 30 minutes apart, even
more preferably less than about 15 minutes apart, and most preferably less than about 5 minutes apart.  Preferably, administration of the combination products of the invention is oral.  The terms oral agent, oral inhibitor, oral compound, or the like, as
used herein, denote compounds which may be orally administered.  Although it is preferable that the cyclic IIb/IIIa antagonist compounds of this invention and the anti-coagulant agent, anti-platelet agent, thrombin inhibitor, and/or thrombolytic agent
are both administered in the same fashion (that is, for example, both orally), if desired, they may each be administered in different fashions (that is, for example, one component of the combination product may be administered orally, and another
component may be administered intravenously).  The dosage of the combination products of the invention may vary depending upon various factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration,
the age, health and weight of the recipient, the nature and extent of the symptoms, the kind of concurrent treatment, the frequency of treatment, and the effect desired, as described above.
<BR><BR>Although the proper dosage of the combination products of this invention will be readily ascertainable by one skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure, by way of general guidance, where the cyclic compounds of this invention are
combined with anti-coagulant agents, for example, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to 10 milligrams of the cyclic compound of this invention and about 1 to 7.5 milligrams of the anticoagulants, preferably about 0.1 to 1 milligrams of the cyclic
compounds of this invention and about 1 to 5 milligrams of the anti-coagulants, per kilogram of patient body weight.  With regard to a typical dosage form of this type of combination product, such as a tablet, the novel compounds of this invention
generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to 10 milligrams, and the anti-coagulants in an amount of about 1 to 5 milligrams.
<BR><BR>Where the novel compounds of this invention are combined with another anti-platelet agent, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to 25 milligrams of the cyclic compounds of this invention and about 50 to 150
milligrams of the additional anti-platelet agents, preferably about 0.1 to 1 milligrams of the novel compounds of this invention and about 1 to 3 milligrams of antiplatelet agents, per kilogram of patient body weight.  With regard to a typical dosage
form of this type of combination product, such as a tablet, the novel compounds of this invention may be present, for example, in an amount of about 5 milligrams, and the additional anti-platelet agent in an amount of about 150 milligrams, or, for
example, in an amount of about 25 milligrams of the cyclic compound of this invention and about 50 milligrams of the additional antiplatelet agent.
<BR><BR>Further, in terms of general guidance, where the novel compounds of this invention are combined with thrombolytic agents, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to 1 milligrams of the cyclic compound of this invention, per kilogram of patient
body weight and, in the case of the thrombolytic agents, the usual dosage of the thrombolytic agent when administered alone may be reduced by about 70-80% when administered with a compound of the present invention.  With regard to a typical dosage form
of this type of combination product, such as a tablet, the novel compounds of this invention may be present, for example, in an amount of about 10 milligrams.
<BR><BR>As discussed above, where two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents are combined or co-administered with the compounds of this invention, generally the amount of each component in a typical daily dosage and typical dosage form may be
reduced relative to the usual dosage of the agent when administered alone, in view of the additive or synergistic effect which would be obtained as a result of addition of further agents in accordance with the present invention.
<BR><BR>Particularly when provided as a single dosage form, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients (for example, a novel compound of this invention and an anti-coagulant such as warfarin or heparin, or a
novel compound of this invention and an anti-platelet agent such as aspirin, piroxicam or ticlopidine, or a novel compound of this invention and a thrombin inhibitor such as a boropeptide, hirudin or argatroban, or a novel compound of this invention and
a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof).  For this reason, the preferred dosage forms of the combination products of this invention are formulated such that although
the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage form, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced).
<BR><BR>In order to minimize contact, one embodiment of this invention where the product is orally administered provides for a combination product wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated.  By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is
possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach
but rather is released in the intestines.  Another embodiment of this invention where oral administration is desired provides for a combination product wherein one of the active ingredients is coated with a sustained-release material which effects a
sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients.  Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this
component occurs only in the intestine.  Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a
polymer such as a lowviscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components.  The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction
with the other component.
<BR><BR>Dosage forms of the combination products of the present invention wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated can be in the form of tablets such that the enteric coated component and the other active ingredient are blended together and then
compressed into a tablet or such that the enteric coated component is compressed into one tablet layer and the other active ingredient is compressed into an additional layer.  Optionally, in order to further separate the two layers, one or more placebo
layers may be present such that the placebo layer is between the layers of active ingredients.  In addition, dosage forms of the present invention can be in the form of capsules wherein one active ingredient is compressed into a tablet or in the form of
a plurality of microtablets, particles, granules or non-perils, which are then enteric coated.  These enteric coated microtablets, particles, granules or non-perils are then placed into a capsule or compressed into a capsule along with a granulation of
the other active ingredient.
<BR><BR>These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner,
will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.
<BR><BR>Pharmaceutical kits useful in, for example, the inhibition of platelet aggregation, the treatment of blood clots, and/or the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a novel cyclic platelet
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa compound of this invention along with a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-coagulant agent such as warfarin or heparin, or an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin, piroxicam or ticlopidine, or a thrombin inhibitor such as a
boropeptide, hirudin or argatroban, or a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase or streptokinase, or combinations thereof, in one or more sterile containers, are also within the ambit of the present invention. 
Sterilization of the container may be carried out using conventional sterilization methodology well known to those skilled in the art.  The sterile containers of materials may comprise separate containers, or one or more multi-part containers, as
exemplified by the UNIVIAL.TM.  twopart container (available from Abbott Labs, Chicago, Ill.), as desired.  The novel compounds of the invention and the anti-coagulant agent, anti-platelet agent, thrombin inhibitor, thrombolytic agent, and/or
combinations thereof, may be separate, or combined into a single dosage form as described above.  Such kits may further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as for example, one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional vials for mixing the components, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.  Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered,
guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, may also be included in the kit.
<BR><BR>The Tables below set forth representative compounds of the present invention.  In the Tables below the biological activity of the compounds is indicated as the IC.sub.50 value in the platelet aggregation assay described above.  The IC.sub.50
values are expressed as: +++=IC.sub.50 value of less than 1 uM; ++=IC.sub.50 value of 1 uM to 10 uM; and; +=IC.sub.50 value of greater than 10 uM to about 100 uM.  As used herein ".mu.M" means micromolar.  Where a mixture of isomers of a compound were
