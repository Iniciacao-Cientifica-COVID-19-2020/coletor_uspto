<CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR> The present disclosure is generally directed to methods of treating hyperglycemia, such as diabetes mellitus, with (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
<BR><BR> 2.  Description of Related Art
<BR><BR> Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which a person's body does not produce enough, or does not properly respond to, insulin.  Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that enables cells to absorb glucose to turn it into energy.  When
insulin production is insufficient or when the body does not properly respond to insulin, glucose accumulates in the blood, which can lead to various complications.  While there are several forms of diabetes, three forms are the most recognized: type I
diabetes, type II diabetes, and gestational diabetes.  Additionally, prediabetes is recognized as preceding diabetes and exists when blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.
<BR><BR> Type I diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a metabolic disorder caused by destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, which leads to insulin deficiency and high levels of glucose in plasma.  The onset
of type I diabetes generally results from an autoimmune etiology; however, idiopathic causes of beta cell destruction can occur for type I. Type 1 diabetes can affect children or adults, but was traditionally termed "juvenile diabetes" because it
represents a majority of the diabetes cases in children.
<BR><BR> Type II diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has been found to possess inheritable aspects which can be greatly impacted by external environmental factors.  The underlying etiologies of type II diabetes include
deficiencies in insulin-producing beta cells; altered response to insulin by muscle, adipose, and liver cells; and abnormalities in the regulating mechanisms responsible for controlling carbohydrate and lipid metabolism following ingestion of food. 
Modulation in insulin-sensitivity is affected by environmental factors and behaviors, mostly a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.  The cellular mechanisms that contribute to modulation of muscle and adipose cell sensitivity to insulin are complex and are
not well understood.  It is believed that altering insulin signaling pathways, increasing the amount of intracellular fat, and elevating levels of free fatty acids and other adipose tissue products can impact insulin-sensitivity.
<BR><BR> Gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women who have not previously been diagnosed with diabetes but who have high glucose levels during pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes affects about 4% of all pregnant women and may precede development of
type II diabetes.
<BR><BR> If not properly controlled or stabilized, a hyperglycemic state has been associated with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, vision impairment, various forms of neuropathy and cognitive impairment, stroke, and peripheral vascular
disease.  The common therapeutic approach, in addition to major modifications in an individual's dietary nutrition and physical activity, includes the use of anti-hyperglycemic drugs and insulin.  Since the disease is chronic and progressive, and so far
no treatment is able to reverse the progression, and thus there remains in this field a need of an improved medicament for treating conditions, diseases and/or disorders associated with hyperglycemia.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader.  This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key/critical elements of the present

construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
<BR><BR> The term "diabetes mellitus" refers to type I, type II diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, and other forms of diabetes.  Other forms diabetes may be latent autoimmune diabetes of adult (LADA), congenital diabetes, steroid diabetes,
pancreatic defects related diabetes (e.g., chronic pancreatitis related diabetes, cystic fibrosis related diabetes, pancreatic neoplasia related diabetes, hemochromatosis related diabetes, and fibrocalculous pancreatopaty related diabetes), edocrinopathy
related diabetes (e.g., acromegaly related diabetes, Crushing syndrome related diabetes, hyperthyroidism related diabetes, pheochromocytoma related diabetes, and glucagonoma related diabetes), infection related diabetes (e.g., cytomegalovirus infection
related diabetes, and coxackievirus B related diabetes), diabetic angiopathy (e.g., diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy), and drug related diabetes (e.g., glucocorticoids related diabetes, thyroid hormone related diabetes, (.beta.-adrenergic
agonists related diabetes, and statins related diabetes).  Frequently correlated with type II diabetes mellitus are one or more of the metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and a pathological glucose tolerance.  Subjects with
diabetes mellitus manifest varying degrees of increased blood pressure, increased Levels of cholesterol and/or triglycerides, increased levels of uric acid and increased levels of factors that promote coagulation.  Therefore, "disorders related to
diabetes mellitus" as used herein refers to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, gout and hypercoagulability, i.e. an abnormal, increased tendency to form clots inside blood vessels.  These disorders are well-recognized risk factors for
atherosclerotic macrovascular as well as microvascular diseases.  Atherosclerotic macrovascular diseases include myocardial infarction, stroke and limb amputation.  Microvascular complications involve blindness, renal diseases and debilitating
neuropathies.
<BR><BR> The term "treatment" as used herein are intended to mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and/or physiologic effect, e.g., reducing blood glucose level in a hyperglycemia subject.  The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or
partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease.  "Treatment" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, preventative (e.g.,
prophylactic), curative or palliative treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly human; and includes: (1) preventative (e.g., prophylactic), curative or palliative treatment of a disease or condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus or disorders related
thereto) from occurring in an individual who may be pre-disposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (2) inhibiting a disease (e.g., by promoting the proliferation of insulin-producing beta cells or suppressing apoptosis of these
cells); or (3) relieving a disease (e.g., reducing symptoms associated with the disease).
<BR><BR> The term "administered", "administering" or "administration" are used interchangeably herein to refer a mode of delivery, including, without limitation, orally, intraveneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intraarterially, intracranially,
transmucosally (e.g., inhalation, and intranasally), or subcutaneously administering of an agent (e.g., a compound or a composition) of the present invention.  In preferred embodiments, the compound of the present disclosure (i.e., (R)-(+)-verapamil) is
formulated into compositions that are suitable for oral administration.
<BR><BR> The term "an effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount effective, at dosages, and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired result with respect to the treatment of a disease resulted from hyperglycemia.  For example, in
the treatment of diabetes mellitus, an agent (i.e., the present compound) which decrease, prevents, delays or suppresses or arrests any symptoms related to diabetes mellitus would be effective.  An effective amount of an agent is not required to cure a
disease or condition but will provide a treatment for a disease or condition such that the onset of the disease or condition is delayed, hindered or prevented, or the disease or condition symptoms are ameliorated.  The specific effective or sufficient
amount will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient (e.g., the patient's body mass, age, or gender), the type of mammal or animal being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of
concurrent therapy (if any), and the specific formulations employed and the like.  Effective amount may be expressed, for example, as the total mass of the active agent (e.g., in grams, milligrams or micrograms) per day.  The effective amount may be
divided into one, two or more doses in a suitable form to be administered at one, two or more times throughout a designated time period.
<BR><BR> The term "subject" or "patient" is used interchangeably herein and is intended to mean a mammal including the human species that is treatable by the compound of the present invention.  The term "mammal" refers to all members of the class
Mammalia, including humans, primates, domestic and farm animals, such as rabbit, pig, sheep, and cattle; as well as zoo, sports or pet animals; and rodents, such as mouse and rat.  Further, the term "subject" or "patient" intended to refer to both the
male and female gender unless one gender is specifically indicated.  Accordingly, the term "subject" or "patient" comprises any mammal which may benefit from the treatment method of the present disclosure.  Examples of a "subject" or "patient" include,
but are not limited to, a human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, pig, goat, cow, horse, dog, cat, bird and fowl.  In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.
<BR><BR> The term "excipient" as used herein means any inert substance (such as a powder or liquid) that forms a vehicle/carrier for the active agent.  The excipient is generally safe, non-toxic, and in a broad sense, may also include any known substance
in the pharmaceutical industry useful for preparing pharmaceutical compositions such as, fillers, diluents, agglutinants, binders, lubricating agents, glidants, stabilizer, colorants, wetting agents, disintegrants, and etc.
<BR><BR> The term "racemic" as used herein refers to a mixture of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, or stereoisomers, of verapamil in which neither enantiomer or stereoisomer is substantially purified from the other.
<BR><BR> II.  Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders Related Thereto
<BR><BR> Verapamil (e.g., 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylmethylamino]-2-pro- pan-2 -ylpentanenitrile) is a known drug with various medicinal indications.  Traditionally, it is used for treating coronary disease, such as
hypertension.  The compound has a stereogenic center, hence can be separated into its optical enantiomers.  The (S)-enantiomer is known to possess the majority of the calcium channel antagonist activity, whereas the (R)-enantiomer is known to possess
agonist activity toward somatostatin receptor 2, and antagonist activity toward orexin receptors 1 and 2, dopamine D.sub.2L receptor, sodium and calcium channels (see WO 2011/057471A1); accordingly, the (R)-enantiomer is useful as a medicament for
treating diseases or conditions related to these receptors in a human subject.
<BR><BR> The present invention in general, relates to novel finding that (R)-(+)-verapamil, is more potent than racemic verapamil, or (S)-(-)-verapamil, in reducing the fasting blood glucose level in a diabetic subject.  Accordingly, the
(R)-(+)-verapamil, may be manufactured into a medicament for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> In this regard, a particular aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a subject suffering from diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.  The method includes the step of, administering to the subject an effective
amount of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl), so as to ameliorate or alleviate symptoms associated to diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil may be obtained from racemic mixture of verapamil by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation or resolution of the enantiomers using any available means, such as optically active resolving acid.  Alternatively,
(R)-(+)-verapamil may be synthesized by stereospecific synthesis using any method known in the related art.  Stereospecific synthesis in general can result in products with high enantiomeric purity.  In cases when the enantiomeric purity is not
sufficient, then the synthetic product may be subject to further purification process to enhance the enantiomeric purity by separating (R)-(+)-verapamil from (S)-(-)-verapamil.  Examples of processes for resolving racemic verapamil to produce
(R)-(+)-verapamil are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR> According to some preferred embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in a crystalline form.  The crystalline of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be
produced by any known crystallization method, e.g., saturation method.  In one example, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl is dissolved in suitable solvent(s), which include but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane/heptane (1:1), until a
saturated solution is obtained; the saturated solution is then cooled to form (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl crystals therefrom.
<BR><BR> According to preferred embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil suitable for use in the present invention is in the form of hydrochloride salt, that is, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl.
<BR><BR> According to optional embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be administered with one or more active compounds other than (R)-(+)-verapamil to ameliorate or alleviate the hyperglycemia state of the
subject.  In some preferred embodiments, the one or more active compound is a blood glucose reduction agent.  Any known blood glucose reduction agent may be used.  Preferably, the blood glucose reduction agent is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
receptor agonist, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, insulin, an insulin analogue, biguanide, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione (TZD), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, or .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor.
<BR><BR> Suitable examples of the GLP-1 receptor agonist include, but are not limited to, liraglutide, exenatide, albiglutide or LY2189265.
<BR><BR> DPP-4 inhibitor is gliptins, and suitable examples of gliptins include, but are not limited to, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, gemigliptin, anagliptin, teneligliptin, alogliptin, trelagliptin, dutogliptin, omarigliptin,
berberine, and lupeol.
<BR><BR> The term "insulin" as used herein refers to purified, synthetic and/or biotechnologically derived products that are the same as, or similar to, naturally occurring insulins in structure, use, and intended effect and are of value in the treatment
of diabetes mellitus.  For example, insulin may be directly recovered from pancreatic tissues of a mammal, such as pancreas glands of farm animals (e.g., pig).  Alternatively, insulin may be produced by recombinant technology
<BR><BR> Examples of the insulin analogue include, but are not limited to, glargine, degludec and detemir.
<BR><BR> Suitable examples of the biguanide include, but are not limited to, metformin, phenformin, and bufomin.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Materials.
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl, (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl as well as the racemic mixture were respectively provided by Center Laboratories Inc (Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.).  Glucometer was purchased from Abbott (USA).  Glucose assay kits were purchased form
Denka Seiken Co.  Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).  Insulin and metformin were both from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), and HbA1c assay kits were from Fujirebio (Japan).
<BR><BR> Animals
<BR><BR> Wide-type male C57BL/6 mice (each weighted about 20-25 g), non-insulin dependent diabetic mellitus (NIDDM) male db/db mice (C57BLKS/J lar-+Lepr.sup.db/+Lepr.sup.db, each weighted about 45.+-.10 g) and db/m+ (C57BLKS/J Lar-m+/+Lepr.sup.db) mice
were used in the present study.
<BR><BR> C57BL/6 mice were provided by BioLASCO Taiwan (authorized by Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, Mass.).
<BR><BR> NIDDM mice and db/m+ mice were provided by Institute for Animal Reproduction (IAR, Japan).  They exhibited hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and islet atrophy and were used at about 10-12 weeks of age.  These animals were housed singly in
Individually Ventilated cages Racks (IVC Racks, 36 Mini Isolator systems (Tecniplast, Italy) throughout the study.
<BR><BR> All were maintained in the animal facility with controlled temperature (20-24.degree.  C., humidity (50-80%) and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (light on at 7:00 a.m.) with food and water provided ad libitum.  Experimental procedures for handling
the mice complied with relevant regulations set forth in "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition" (National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2011) in AAALAC-accredited laboratory animal facility.  (Eurofins Panlabs Taiwan,
Ltd.)
<BR><BR> STZ-Induced Diabetic Mice and Treatment
<BR><BR> Wide-type male C57BL/6 mice were rendered diabetic by multiple intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/Kg/day for 5 days, day 1 to day 5).  Mice exhibited an averaged blood glucose level greater than 160 mg/dL on day 6 were
selected for subsequent study.  The vehicle or test compound (i.e., verapamil HCl in racemic form (VPM, bid), (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM, bid) or (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl (S-VPM, bid)) at the designated dose was orally fed to each mice twice daily from
day 6, and continued for 44 days to day 49.  For animals treated with insulin, insulin was administered subcutaneously 90 minutes before blood glucose measurement.  Non-fasting blood glucose level was measured on days 6, 15, and 25, whereas fasting blood
glucose (i.e., blood glucose level after fasting for 12 hrs fasting) was measured on days 40 and 50.
<BR><BR> NIDDM Mice and Treatment
<BR><BR> NIDDM mice and db/m+ mice (the sham control) were acclimated at least one week and then grouped for treatment when the average blood glucose value was .gtoreq.350 mg/dl after 6-hr fasting.  Test compounds (i.e., verapamil HCl in racemic form
(VPM, bid), (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM, bid), (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl (S-VPM, bid), metformin (once daily), or the combination of R-VPM (bid) and metformin (Met, once daily)) at the designated dose was orally fed to each mice from day 1, and continued
for 44 consecutive days to day 45 (EXAMPLE 1.2) or for 42 consecutive days to day 43 (EXAMPLE 2).  Blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured on designated days after 6-hr fasting.  Body weight of each test animal was also
measured during the study period.
<BR><BR> It was noted that during the pre-run of this experiment (EXAMPLE 1.2), administration of 50 mg/Kg, bid of VPM or S-VPM resulted in death of all the test animals, thus, in this experiment, the dose of VPM or S-VPM was set to be not more than 50
mg/Kg, bid (such as 15 or 30 mg/Kg, bid).  The dose for R-VPM, on the other hand, was not bound by such limitation.
<BR><BR> Statistics
<BR><BR> Results were expressed as the mean .+-.standard error of the mean (SEM).  Unpaired student's t-test or 1-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test was used for statistical comparisons between substance-treated and vehicle-treated groups.  Differences
are considered significant at .dagger.P&lt;0.05, vs vehicle control (db/m+); *P&lt;0.05, vs vehicle control (db/db or STZ-induced mice); #P&lt;0.05, vs metformin (db/db).  Comparisons of "Met" and "vehicle control (db/db)" by Student's unpaired t-test:
significance denoted by solid lines and trends denoted by dashed lines.
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR>Effects of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl on Blood Glucose Level in Diabetic Mice
<BR><BR> 1.1 STZ-induced Diabetic Mice
<BR><BR> In this example, the effects of racemic verapamil HCl (VPM), (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) or (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl (S-VPM) was evaluated in STZ-induced diabetic animals in accordance with procedures described in the "Materials and Methods"
section.  Results are illustrated in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> As depicted in FIG. 1, insulin was capable of reducing the level of non-fasting or fasting blood glucose in STZ-induced diabetic animals, whereas racemic verapamil (25 or 35 mg/Kg, bid) had no effects on either fasting or non-fasting blood
glucose level.  As to the effects of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl and (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl, it appeared that (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was relatively more potent than (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl in reducing the level of fasting blood glucose.
<BR><BR> 1.2 Non-insulin Dependent Diabetic Mellitus (NIDDM) Mice
<BR><BR> In this example, the effects of racemic verapamil HCl (VPM), (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) or (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl (S-VPM) on blood glucose level were evaluated by use of NIDDM mice, which were born with mild defects in the insulin signaling
cascade that gave rise to insulin resistance and subsequent progression to a diabetic phenotype.  For comparison, a group of 5 db/m+ (C57BLKS/J Lar-m+/+Lepr.sup.db) mice were used as the sham control.  Blood glucose levels were measured on day 0 (before
treatment), and on days 15, 30, and 45 in the 6-hr fasting animals.  Results are illustrated in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR> As expected, metformin (300 mg/Kg) reduced the level of fasting blood glucose in NIDDM mice; however, neither racemic verapamil HCl (30 mg/Kg, bid) nor (S)-(-)-verapamil HCl, possessed any effect on reduction of fasting blood glucose level.  By
contrast, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl at the doses of 50 and 75 mg/Kg, bid respectively reduced the fasting blood glucose level, as compared with that of the control vehicle NIDDM mice.
<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR>Combined Treatment of (R)-(+)-Verapamil HCl and Metformin Synergistically Reduced Blood Glucose Level and Glycated Haemolglobin (HbA1c) Level in NIDDM Mice
<BR><BR> Based on the finding of example 1.2, the combined effects of metformin and (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) on fasting blood glucose and glycated hemolglobin (HbA1c) were further evaluated in NIDDM mice.  For comparison, a group of 8 db/m+
(C57BLKS/J Lar-m+/+Lepr.sup.db) mice were used as the sham control.  Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were respectively measured on day 0 (before treatment), and on day 15, 29 and 43 in the 6-hr fasting animals.  Results are provided in FIGS. 3 and 4;
and Tables 1 to 6.
<BR><BR> 2.1 Blood Glucose Level
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 3, as expected, metformin could reduce the blood glucose levels of NIDDM mice on days 15, 29 and 43, so did (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) at higher dose (i.e., 30 or 50 mg/Kg, bid).  More surprisingly, the combined treatment of
R-VPM and metformin exhibited a synergistic effect on the reduction of blood glucose level, even in the case when low dose R-VPM (i.e., 15 mg/Kg, bid) was administered, which dose was ineffective in reducing blood glucose level on its own.
<BR><BR> Referring to Table 1, which summarizes the relative blood glucose levels collected from NIDDM mice treated with (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM, 15 mg/kg, bid), metformin (300 mg/Kg) or both, as compared to the respective control levels in the
present study.  In Table 1, blood glucose level in each treatment group was expressed as % of the control, which was the blood glucose level on day 0 and was taken to be 100%.  In the "vehicle" group, it was found that blood glucose levels were
respectively 97.1%, 116.4% and 121.6% over that of the control on days 15, 29, and 43 (see column A in Table 1).  In the "metformin" group, blood glucose levels on days 15, 29, and 43 were respectively 65.3%, 103.6% and 108.8% over that of day 0 (i.e.,
column B), when these values were compared with those in the "vehicle" group, it was apparent that metformin successfully reduced blood glucose level for about 31.8%, 12.8%, and 12.8% on days 15, 29 and 43 (i.e., column C).  As to the effect of R-VPM,
blood glucose levels were even higher than those of the control (column D vs column A), and no reduction in blood glucose level was observed (i.e., column E); indicating that (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl at the dose of 15 mg/kg, bid possessed no treatment
effect.  By contrast, the combined treatment of R-VPM and metformin resulted in about 42.5%, 35% and 47.6% reduction in blood glucose levels on days 15, 29, and 43 (column H), which were much lower than the summation of blood glucose changes resulted by
metformin alone and R-VPM alone (column H vs column F).  Taken together, the data suggested that the combined treatment of R-VPM and metformin may synergistically reduce blood glucose level in diabetic animals, in which the reduction were about 1.44,
4.61 and 2.45 folds (i.e., column I) over that of the control (i.e., column F).
<BR><BR> Similar synergistic effects on the reduction of blood glucose levels were also observed for the combined treatment of metformin and (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl at higher doses, in which the reductions were respectively about 1.11, 1.49 and 1.52 folds
(column I, Table 2) over those of control (column F, Table 2) for R-VPM at 30 mg/Kg, bid, and about 1.17, 1.24, and 1.30 folds (column I, Tables 3) over those of control (column F, Table 3) for R-VPM at 50 mg/Kg, bid.

<BR><BR> 2.2 Glycated Haemolglobin (HbA1c) Level
<BR><BR> Another common indicator, glycated haemolglobin (HbA1c), which reflects average blood glucose levels over a duration was also measured in the present study.  HbA1c develops when haemolglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen
throughout the body joins with glucose in the blood and becomes "glycated." Since red blood cells in a human body survive for about 8-12 weeks before renewal, thus, the level of HbA1c gives an overall picture of average blood sugar levels over such
period.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 4, which depicts the effects of metformin, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) or both on the level of HbA1c in NIDDM mice.  It was found that metformin significantly reduce HbA1c level, and R-VPM had no effect at the doses of 15
mg/Kg, bid, and mild reduction was observed at the dose of 30 mg/Kg, bid.  However, combined treatment with metformin and R-VPM produced a synergistic reduction in the level of HbA1c in NIDDM mice, similar to the findings in Example 2.1.  As summarized
in Table 4, combined treatment of 15 mg/Kg, bid (R)-(+)-verapamil and metformin resulted in 1.56, 11.94, and 3.84 folds (column I, Table 4) reduction in HbA1c levels were found on days 15, 29, and 43, respectively, as compared to the summation of HbA1c
changes resulted from metformin alone and R-VMP alone (column F, Table 4).  Similar findings were found in Tables 5 and 6, in which the reduction were respectively about 1.45, 6.71, and 1.13 folds (column I, Table 5) over those of control (column F,
Table 5) for R-VMP at 30 mg/Kg, bid, and about 1.10, 2.92 and 1.41 folds (column I, Table 6) over those of control (column F, Table 6) for V-RMP at 50 mg/Kg, bid.

<BR><BR> Taken together of the findings in the working examples, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl alone (.gtoreq.25 mg/Kg, bid) is effective in reducing blood glucose level, thus is useful for treating diabetes.  Most surprisingly is that the combined treatment of
metformin (300 mg/Kg) and (R)-(+)-verapamil (.gtoreq.15 mg/Kg, bid) produces synergistic reduction in blood glucose level, as well as in the level of long-term diabetic indicator--HbA1c.  Accordingly, (R)-(+)-verapamil is suitable for use as a lead
compound for the development of a blood glucose reduction agent for treating diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.
