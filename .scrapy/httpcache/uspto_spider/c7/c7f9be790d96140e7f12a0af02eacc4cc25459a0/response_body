         <HR>
<CENTER><b><i>Claims</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>What is claimed is: <BR><BR>1.  A process for obtaining (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of aspirin derivatives of formula R--COOH wherein R is selected from one of the radicals having the following formula:
##STR6## wherein: R.sub.1 is the OCOR.sub.3 group;  wherein R.sub.3 is methyl, ethyl or alkyl C.sub.3 -C.sub.5 linear or branched, or the residue of a saturated heterocyclic ring having 5 or 6 atoms, containing hetero-atoms independently selected between
O and N;  R.sub.2 is hydrogen, halogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, linear or branched when possible, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxyl, linear or branched when possible;  C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 perfluoroalkyl, linear or branched when possible;  nitro, mono- or
di-(C.sub.1-4) alkylamino;  R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 taken together are the dioxymethylene group, with the proviso that in the formula Ib) R.sub.1 cannot be OCOR.sub.3 in position 2 when R.sub.3 is methyl;  nI is an integer and can take the values 0 or 1; 
said synthesis process comprising the following steps: (1) reaction between the halide R--C(O)--XI (A) wherein: X.sub.I is Cl, Br, R being a radical as above defined, with an isomer of the hydroxy-benzaldehyde, in the presence of a base, with formation
of a (carbonyl)phenyl ester;  (2) reduction of aldehydic group of the (carbonyl)phenyl ester with formation of an (hydroxymethyl)phenyl ester;  (3) reaction between (hydroxymethyl) phenyl ester of formula (II) with: a) SoX.sub.2, X being an halogen
selected between Cl and Br, or b) tosyl chloride or mesyl chloride (4) reaction between the ester isolated at the previous step with an inorganic nitrate salt, which metal cation belongs to the group IB or IIB, with formation of the (nitroxymethyl)
phenyl ester.
<BR><BR>2.  A process according to claim 1, wherein the formation of the (carbonyl)phenyl ester expected in step (1) is alternatively carried out by reacting the aspirin derivative of formula R--COOH with a dehydrating agent in the presence of an
aminopyridine derivative N, N di-substituted with alkyl radicals C.sub.1 -C.sub.4, or of a C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkylchloroformate in the presence of a base, or with N, N' carbonyldiimidazole.
<BR><BR>3.  A process according to claim 1, wherein the nitrate used in step (4) is silver nitrate.
<BR><BR>4.  A process according to claim 1, wherein the aspirin derivative of formula R--COOH is the acetylsalicylic acid.
<BR><BR>5.  (Hydroxymethyl)phenylester of aspirin derivatives of formula R--COOH, wherein R is as above defined in claim 1. <HR> <CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>The present invention relates to an improved synthesis for obtaining
(nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of aspirin derivatives.
<BR><BR>These esters have interesting pharmacological and therapeutical properties; specifically they show an improved systemic and local tolerability, at the level of the gastric mucosa (WO 95/030641) and they are more effective as antithrombotic
medicines (WO 97/16405).
<BR><BR>It is known in the prior art that the (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of the aspirin derivatives are prepared by reacting (nitroxymethyl)phenol with the aspirin derivative in the acid form (WO 97/16405).
<BR><BR>In particular the preparation of (nitroxymethyl)phenol is carried out starting from (hydroxymethyl)phenol through the following steps: reaction of phenol with HBr in an organic solvent to obtain (bromomethyl)phenol; reaction of
(bromomethyl)phenol in an organic solvent with AgNO.sub.3 to form (nitroxymethyl)phenol.
<BR><BR>The synthesis of the (nitroxymethyl)phenol intermediate has the following drawbacks.  The (bromomethyl)phenol is a chemically unstable and irritant compound.  The nitroxy derivative obtained from (bromomethyl-)phenol is still an unstable
compound, which must be purified before reaction with the acid chloride.  The (nitroxymethyl)phenol may further decompose in a not controllable way; consequently in order to obtain, on an industrial scale, the compound with the required purity for the
final esterification step, the purification processes normally used in laboratory organic syntheses cannot be employed.
<BR><BR>In conclusion the use of (nitroxymethyl)phenol in the synthesis of (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of aspirin derivatives is not industrially practicable.
<BR><BR>It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly found by the Applicant that it is possible to synthetize (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of aspirin derivatives, and specifically (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of the N-acetylsalicylic acid, by synthetic
reactions by which it can be avoided the use of the above mentioned phenol derivatives, and thus the purification steps of the intermediate compounds, obtaining the final products in good yields.  Thus the new process is more advantageous than those of
the prior art.
<BR><BR>It is therefore an object of the present invention a new process for obtaining (nitroxymethyl)phenyl esters of aspirin derivatives of formula R--COOH wherein R is selected from one of the radicals having the following formula: ##STR1##
<BR><BR>wherein:
<BR><BR>R.sub.1 is the OCOR.sub.3 group; wherein R.sub.3 is methyl, ethyl or alkyl C.sub.3 -C.sub.5, linear or branched, or the residue of a saturated heterocyclic ring having 5 or 6 atoms, containing hetero-atoms independently selected between O and N;
R.sub.2 is hydrogen, halogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, linear or branched when possible, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxyl, linear or branched when possible; C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 perfluoroalkyl, linear or branched when possible, for example trifluoromethyl; nitro,
mono- or di-(C.sub.1-4) alkylamino; R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 taken together are the dioxymethylene group, with the proviso in the formula Ib) that R.sub.1 cannot be OCOR.sub.3 in position 2 when R.sub.3 is methyl; nI is an integer and can have the values 0 or
1; preferably in Ia) R.sub.1 is acetoxy, preferably in ortho position with respect to the --CO-- group, R.sub.2 is hydrogen; preferably in Ib) R.sub.3 =CH.sub.3, nI=0; preferably R--COOH is the acetylsalicylic acid; said process comprising the following
steps, generally carried out in the presence of a solvent inert under the reaction conditions:
<BR><BR>(1) reaction between the acid halide R--C(O)--X-- wherein: X.sub.I is an halogen selected between Cl and Br, R is a radical as above defined, in the presence of a base, with an isomer of the hydroxybenzaldehyde, i.e., wherein the hydroxyl group
can be at ortho, meta or para position, with formation of a (carbonyl)phenyl ester (I): ##STR2##
<BR><BR>(2) selective reduction of the aldehydic group of compound (I) with formation of an (hydroxymethyl)phenyl ester (II): ##STR3##
<BR><BR>(3) reaction between the (hydroxymethyl) phenyl ester of formula (II) with: a) SOX.sub.2, X being an halogen selected between Cl and Br, with formation of an (halogenomethyl)phenyl ester of formula (III), wherein X=halogen, or b) tosyl chloride
or mesyl chloride with formation of a (tosyloxymethyl)- or (mesyloxymethyl)-phenylester, X being=O-tosyl or O-mesyl in formula (III): ##STR4##
<BR><BR>(4) reaction between the compound of formula (III) with an inorganic nitrate salt, the metal cation of which belongs to the group IB or IIB, with formation of the corresponding (nitroxymethyl) phenyl ester ##STR5##
<BR><BR>The formation of the (carbonyl)phenyl ester of step (1) can alternatively be achieved by other reactions.  For example by reaction of the aspirin derivative of general formula R--COOH with a dehydrating agent, such as for example N,
N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in the presence of an aminopyridine derivative N, N disubstituted with alkyl radicals C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 (step (1.sup.I)), or with a C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkylchloroformate in the presence of a base, soluble or insoluble in the
reaction medium, as defined hereinafter (step (1.sup.II)), or with N, N' carbonyldiimidazol (step (1.sup.III)).
<BR><BR>The process object of the present invention allows to obtain products at the required purity degree.  Thus it is not necessary to purify the product compounds obtainable after each step.  The overall yields are good (50-70%).
<BR><BR>In step (1), the aspirin derivative acyl chloride or bromide, prepared from the corresponding compound in the acid form by using known reactants (ex.  thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, oxalyl chloride, oxalyl bromide, PCl.sub.3, PBr.sub.3), is
let react in inert solvents (for example halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane; ethers, such as ethyl ether, propyl ether, isopropyl ether, dioxane; esters such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate), in the
presence of an organic or inorganic base, with an hydroxybenzaldehyde isomer as above defined.  Said base can be soluble in the reaction solvent, as in the case of tertiary aliphatic amines of formula N(R.sub.N).sub.3, wherein R.sub.N is an alkyl group
C.sub.1 -C.sub.4, such as for example tributylamine, triethylamine, diethylmethylamine, trimethylamine; or said base can either be insoluble in the solvent, such as for example in the case of alkaline inorganic salts, for example, potassium carbonate,
sodium carbonate, or alkaline metal bases such as NaOH and KOH.
<BR><BR>When step 1) is substituted with step (1.sup.I) as above defined, the aminopyridine derivative N, N disubstituted with alkyl radicals C.sub.1 -C.sub.4, used in combination with the dehydrating agent, is preferably selected for example from
dimethylamino pyridine and dibutylamino pyridine; when instead step (1.sup.II) is used, the compound C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkylchloroformate is preferably selected between ethylchloroformate and isobutylchloroformate.
<BR><BR>The reaction (2) of selective reduction of the aldehydic group to alcohol can be carried out by hydrogenation with gaseous hydrogen using conventional catalyts supported on carbon, such as for example, palladium, in a solution of the compound of
formula (I) in an inert solvent.  The reaction temperature is in the range 0-40.degree.  C., the gas pressure can range from 1 to 3 atm.
<BR><BR>In alternative to the hydrogenation with gaseous hydrogen, reduction of compound (II) can be effected also with other reducing agents, for example inorganic mixed hydrides, such as for example NaBH.sub.4, under the conditions well known to the
skilled in the field.
<BR><BR>Step (3) is carried out in an inert organic solvent at a temperature in the range 0.degree.-40.degree.  C.
<BR><BR>The alternative reaction between the alcohol and the tosyl chloride or mesyl chloride is carried out according to the known methods of the prior art.
<BR><BR>Step (4) is carried out by adding an inorganic nitrate salt which cation is selected from metals belonging to the Groups IB and IIB, to a solution of the compound of formula (III), wherein X is halogen as above defined, or O-tosyl or O-mesyl, in
an organic solvent wherein said nitrate salt should be soluble, such as for example acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran.  The cation of the salt can be zinc, silver or mercury.  Preferably the salt is silver nitrate.  The reaction temperature can range between
20.degree.  and 90.degree.  C. The synthesis appears to be specific: when in the process object of the present invention are used as starting compounds other therapeutically active molecules having a reactive carboxylic function, it is found that the
corresponding nitroxymethylphenyl esters are obtained with lower yields, as it is shown in the Examples.
<BR><BR>The following Examples are given with the only purpose to illustrate the invention and they do not limit the same. <BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Preparation of the 2-(acetyloxy) benzoic acid 3-(nitroxymethyl)-phenyl ester
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1a
<BR><BR>Preparation of the 2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 3-(formyl)phenyl ester
<BR><BR>A mixture of 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (830 g) and triethylamine (8.24 g) in methylene chloride (12.6 l) is kept under stirring, in inert nitrogen atmosphere, cooling at a temperature between -5.degree.  C. and 0.degree.  C. Salicyloyl chloride (1650
