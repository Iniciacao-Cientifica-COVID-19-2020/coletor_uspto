<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention may comprise any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt, including, but not limited to, acid addition salts and base addition salts.  Examples of suitable salts can be found, for example, in STAHL AND
WERMUTH, HANDBOOK OF PHARMACEUTICAL SALTS PROPERTIES, SELECTION, AND USE, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany (2002); and Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, J. PHARM.  SCI.  66:1-19 (1977).  In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a
disalt.  In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is an L-tartrate salt.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, non-toxic salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, phosphorus, and the like, as well as the
salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts thus include the acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate (benzenesulfonate), bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulfate, caprylate, camsylate (camphor sulfonate), chlorobenzoate, citrate, edisylate (1,2-ethane disulfonate), dihydrogenphosphate,
dinitrobenzoate, esylate (ethane sulfonate), fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isobutyrate, monohydrogen phosphate, isethionate, D-lactate, L-lactate, malate,
maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate (methanesulfonate), metaphosphate, methylbenzoate, methylsulfate, 2-napsylate (2-naphthalene sulfonate), nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmoate, phenylacetate, phosphate, phthalate, propionate,
pyrophosphate, pyrosulfate, saccharate, sebacate, stearate, suberate, succinate sulfate, sulfite, D-tartrate, L-tartrate, tosylate (toluene sulfonate), and xinafoate salts, and the like of Formulas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII.  Also contemplated
are the salts of amino acids such as arginate, gluconate, galacturonate, and the like.
<BR><BR> Acid addition salts of Formulas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII may be prepared by contacting the free form of the basic compound with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner.  The free form may
be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free form in the conventional manner.  The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties (e.g., solubility in polar solvents), but
may otherwise be equivalent to their respective salt forms.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or of organic amines.  Examples of metals used as cations are aluminum, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium, and the like.  Examples of suitable amines include arginine, choline, chloroprocaine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, diolamine, ethylenediamine (ethane-1,2-diamine), glycine, lysine, meglumine, N-methylglucamine,
olamine, procaine (benzathine), and tromethamine.
<BR><BR> The base addition salts of Formulas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII may be prepared by contacting the free form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner.  The free form may be regenerated by
contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free form in a conventional manner.  The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties (e.g., solubility in polar solvents), but may otherwise be
equivalent to their respective free salt forms.
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention may comprise any suitable prodrug, including, but not limited to, esterified forms of Formulas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII.
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention may possess one or more desirable pharmacokinetic and/or physiological properties.  In some embodiments, the compound exhibits improved solubility (e.g., aqueous solubility), absorption, metabolism and/or
clinical efficacy (as compared to the individual moieties that make up the compound, for example).
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention may have greater and/or more prolonged therapeutic effects than the individual moieties that make up the compound.  For example, administration of a conjugate compound comprising aspirin and gingerol may have a
more pronounced anti-tumorigenesis effect than administration of aspirin and gingerol (and/or administration of an aspirin derivative/analog and a gingerol derivative/analog).  Accordingly, compositions of the present application may achieve adequate
anti-tumor efficacy at a lower dose than that required for the individual moieties that make up the compound.
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention may have fewer and/or less pronounced adverse effects (e.g., adverse GI effects associated with the administration of aspirin) than the individual moieties that make up the compound.  For example,
administration of a conjugate compound comprising an aspirin derivative and a stilbene derivative may produce fewer adverse effects than administration of the aspirin derivative and the stilbene derivative (and/or administration of aspirin and stilbene
themselves).  The use of a sustained-release formulation for delivery of the compound may further reduce any adverse effects.

suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above.  The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a
solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder.  Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.  In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be
employed as a solvent or suspending medium.  For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides.  In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.
<BR><BR> As noted above, formulations of the present invention suitable for oral-administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or
granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion.  The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.
<BR><BR> A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.  Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or
granules, optionally mixed with a binder (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose)
surface active or dispersing agent.  Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.  The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to
provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile.  Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide
release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be in immediate-release formulations.  A variety of known methods and materials may be used to bring about the immediate release.  For instance, placing the compound of the present
invention along an exterior of a tablet (e.g., coating the exterior or formulating the outer layer with the agent) and/or combined with forming a tablet by compressing the powder using low compaction can produce immediate-release of the compound of the
present invention from the composition.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be in controlled-release and/or sustained-release formulations.  Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise one or more carriers that protect the compound of the
present invention against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release formulations or coatings.  Such carriers include controlled-release formulations, including, for example, microencapsulated delivery systems.  Compounds of the present
invention can be included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in amounts sufficient to treat an individual.  The controlled-release form can be in an amount that is effective to protect the compound of the present invention from rapid elimination
from the body, or to provide a sustained release or dosage, such as between about 1 .mu.g/kg/min to about 500 .mu.g/kg/min, or alternately between about 2 .mu.g/kg/min to about 250 .mu.g/kg/min. Generally the controlled release dosage form provides less
than 100 .mu.g/kg/min, less than 50 .mu.g/kg/min or even less than 10 .mu.g/kg/min.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is in oral dosage form and comprises a matrix that includes a controlled-release material.  In certain embodiments, the matrix is compressible into a tablet and can be optionally overcoated
with a coating that can control the release of the compound of the present invention from the composition.  In this embodiment, the compound of the present invention is maintained within a therapeutic range over an extended period of time.  In certain
alternate embodiments, the matrix is encapsulated.
<BR><BR> Tablets or capsules containing a composition of the present application can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action.  For example, the tablet or capsule can contain an inner dosage
and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former.  The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into
the duodenum or to be delayed in release.  For controlled extended release, the capsule can also have micro drilled holes.
<BR><BR> A coating comprising an initial dose or first dose of a compound of the present invention in immediate-release form can be added to the outside of a controlled-release tablet core comprising a second dose of a compound of the present invention
to produce a final dosage form.  Such a coating can be prepared by admixing the first dosage with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 29/32 or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and water/isopropyl alcohol and triethyl acetate.  Such an immediate-release
coating can be spray coated onto the tablet cores.  The immediate-release coating can also be applied using a press-coating process with a blend consisting of 80% by weight promethazine and 20% by weight of lactose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose type
2910.  Press-coating techniques are known in the art.
<BR><BR> The immediate-release or controlled-release dosage forms of the present invention can also take the form of a multilayer tablet, such as a bi-layered tablet, which comprises a first layer and a second layer.  In a further aspect of the
bi-layered tablet, the first layer is an immediate release layer and/or the second layer is a controlled-release layer.  For example, a multilayered tablet can comprise at least one immediate release layer comprising an amount of a compound of the
present invention and at least one controlled release layer which comprises an amount of a compound of the present invention.  The controlled release layer may provide sustained release of a compound of the present invention, for a period of time. 
Alternatively, the immediate release layer and the controlled released layer may provide sustained release of a compound of the present invention, but at different dosage amounts.
<BR><BR> The immediate-release or controlled release dosage forms of the present invention can also take the form of pharmaceutical particles manufactured by a variety of methods, including but not limited to high-pressure homogenization, wet or dry ball
milling, or small particle precipitation.  Other methods to make a suitable powder formulation are the preparation of a solution of active ingredients and excipients, followed by precipitation, filtration, and pulverization, or followed by removal of the
solvent by freeze-drying, followed by pulverization of the powder to the desired particle size.  These dosage forms can include immediate-release particles in combination with controlled-release particles in a ratio sufficient useful for delivering the
desired dosages of the compound of the present invention.
<BR><BR> In another aspect of the present application, the components are released from a multi-layered tablet that comprises at least a first layer, a second layer and a third layer.  Wherein, the layers containing the compound of the present invention
can be optionally separated by one or more layers of inert materials.  In one embodiment the layers containing a compound of the present invention have similar rates of release (e.g., all are immediate-release or all are controlled-release).  In an
alternative embodiment the layers have different rates of release.  In this aspect at least one layer is an immediate release layer and at least one layer is a controlled release layer.
<BR><BR> Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of
the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.  The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may
be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.  Injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules
and tablets of the kind previously described.
<BR><BR> Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the compound of the present invention in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the compound of the present
invention in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the compound of the present invention in a suitable liquid carrier.
<BR><BR> Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.
<BR><BR> Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the compound of the present invention such carriers as are known in the art to

<BR><BR> Transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive disc or patch that slowly releases the active ingredient for percutaneous absorption may be used.  To this end, permeation enhancers may be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of
the active agent.  For example, for transdermal administration, the compound of the present invention may be combined with skin penetration enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropanol, ethanol, oleic acid, N-methylpyrrolidone,
dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like, which increase the permeability of the skin to the compound of the present invention, and permit it to penetrate through the skin and into the bloodstream.  The compound of the present invention may also be combined with
a polymeric substance, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene/vinylacetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like, to provide the composition in gel form, which may be dissolved in solvent, such as methylene chloride, evaporated to the
desired viscosity, and then applied to backing material to provide a patch.  The compound of the present invention may be administered transdermally to achieve a local concentration of the active agent or to achieve systemic administration of the active
agent.
<BR><BR> Generally speaking, transdermal drug delivery systems are commonly either reservoir-type or matrix-type devices.  Both types of devices include a backing layer that forms the outer surface of the finished transdermal device and which is exposed
to the environment during use, and a release liner or protective layer that forms the inner surface and which covers the adhesive means for affixing the devices to the skin or mucosa of a user.  The release liner or protective layer is removed prior to
application, exposing the adhesive means which is typically a pressure-sensitive adhesive.  The active agent is located between the release liner and backing layer, usually solubilized or dispersed in a solvent or carrier composition.  In some
embodiments, the outer surface of the transdermal device (e.g., patch) is adapted to associate with a second component, such as a heating compartment (e.g., electrical or chemical means for providing controlled and consistent increase in temperature).
<BR><BR> Compositions of the present invention may be used to prevent, diagnose, monitor and/or treat any suitable disorder, including, but not limited to, cancer.  In some embodiments, the disorder is a gastrointestinal cancer, such as an anal cancer,

<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method comprises, consists essentially of or consists of administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method comprises, consists essentially of or consists of administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound comprising a first moiety and a second moiety, wherein the first and second moieties
are covalently linked, wherein the first moiety is aspirin, an aspirin analog or an aspirin derivative and wherein the second moiety is stilbene, an analog or derivative of stilbene, gingerol, an analog or derivative of gingerol, shogaol, an analog or
derivative of shogaol, zingerone or an analog or derivative of zingerone.
<BR><BR> In some such embodiments, the composition is a compound of the present invention.  In some such embodiments, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.  In some such embodiments, the composition is a compound
comprising a first moiety and a second moiety, wherein the first and second moieties are covalently linked, wherein the first moiety is aspirin, an aspirin analog or an aspirin derivative and wherein the second moiety is stilbene, an analog or derivative
of stilbene, gingerol, an analog or derivative of gingerol, shogaol, an analog or derivative of shogaol, zingerone or an analog or derivative of zingerone.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, administration of the composition results in the prevention and/or treatment of a first disorder and the prevention and/or treatment of a second disorder.  For example, administration of the composition may result in the
treatment of rectal cancer and the prevention of colon cancer (by preventing metastasis, for example).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the subject exhibits one or more risk factors associated with the disorder.  For example, the subject may have a familial history of cancer, one or more pre-cancerous lesions, premalignant cells, preneoplastic cells or other
aberrant phenotypes indicating probably progression to a cancerous state.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the subject is a human.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the composition is administered in combination with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, gene therapy, RNA therapy, adjuvant therapy, immunotherapy, nanotherapy or a combination thereof.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method further comprises administering to the subject at least one supplemental agent.  In some embodiments, the at least one supplemental agent comprises a therapeutic agent such as an antitumor alkylating agent, an
antitumor antimetabolite, an antitumor antibiotics, a plant-derived antitumor agent, an antitumor organoplatinum compound, an antitumor campthotecin derivative, an antitumor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a monoclonal antibody, an interferon, a biological
response modifier, a hormonal anti-tumor agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor, an anti-metastatic agent, a differentiating agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a chemopreventative agent, a gene therapy agent, an enzymatic inhibitor or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt or prodrug of any of the foregoing.  In some such embodiments, the other therapeutic agent is administered prior to, concomitant with or subsequent to administering the composition of the present invention.  In some such embodiments, the
composition(s) of the present invention and the supplemental agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically.
<BR><BR> Combination therapy may include the administration of a composition of the present invention and at least one supplemental agent as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of the
therapeutic agents.  The beneficial effects of the combination may include, but are not limited to, pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents.  Administration of the therapeutic agents in
combination may be carried out over a defined time period (e.g., minutes, hours, days or weeks, depending upon the combination selected).  Combination therapy can be carried out either sequentially or substantially simultaneously.  In the case of
sequential administration of more than one therapeutic agent, each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time.  In the case of simultaneous administration, at least two of the therapeutic agents are administered in a substantially simultaneous
manner, either in the same pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions.  Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each
therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents.  In one embodiment, a composition comprising a conjugate of the application is administered concurrently with the administration of another therapeutic agent, which can
be part of the same composition as the conjugate of the application or a different composition.  In another embodiment, a composition comprising a conjugate of the application is administered prior to, or subsequent to, administration of another
therapeutic agent.
<BR><BR> Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous
membrane tissues.  The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes.  For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected can be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of
the combination can be administered orally.  Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents can be administered orally or all therapeutic agents can be administered by intravenous injection.  The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are
administered is not narrowly critical.  In some embodiments, the therapeutic agents are administered within about 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2.5
hours, 3 hours, 3.5 hours, 4 hours, 4.5 hours, 5 hours, 5.5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks or 4 weeks of one another.
<BR><BR> Combination therapy also encompasses the administration of the conjugate as described above in further combination with other therapies including but not limited to chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, RNA
therapy, adjuvant therapy, nanotherapy or a combination thereof.  Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment can be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the
combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved.  For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, by
a significant period of time.  The conjugate and the other pharmacologically active agent can be administered to a subject simultaneously, sequentially or in combination.  It will be appreciated that when using a combination of the application, the
conjugate of the application and the other pharmacologically active agent can be in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and therefore administered simultaneously.  They can be in separate pharmaceutical carriers such as conventional oral dosage
forms which are taken simultaneously.  The term "combination" further refers to the case where the compounds are provided in separate dosage forms and are administered sequentially.
<BR><BR> The composition may be administered using any suitable method known in the art, including, but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., intraarterial, intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous, intramuscular and intrathecal), intraperitoneal (i.p.),
intrarectal, intravaginal, intranasal, intragastric, intratracheal, sublingual, transcutaneous, intrapulmonary and topical administration.  In some embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered orally, parenterally, topically or
rectally.  In some embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered via inhalation (e.g., as a spray or powder).  In some embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is injected directly into a tumor.  In some
embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered as a depot formulation.  In some embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered intraarterially and/or intravenously via a catheter.
<BR><BR> Methods of the present invention may be used to prevent, diagnose, monitory and/or treat any suitable disorder, including, but not limited to, cancer.  In some embodiments, the disorder is a gastrointestinal cancer, such as an anal cancer, an
esophageal cancer, a stomach cancer, a liver cancer, a gallbladder cancer, a pancreatic cancer, a colon cancer or a rectal cancer.  In some embodiments, the disorder is lung cancer.  In some embodiments, the disorder is a metastatic disorder (e.g.,
metastatic cancer).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, administration of the composition produces fewer and/or less pronounced adverse effects (e.g., adverse GI effects associated with the administration of aspirin) than the individual moieties that make up the compound.  For
example, administration of a conjugate compound comprising an aspirin derivative and a stilbene derivative may produce fewer adverse effects than administration of the aspirin derivative and the stilbene derivative (and/or administration of aspirin and
stilbene themselves).  Administration of a sustained-release formulation of the composition may further reduce any adverse effects, allowing for the administration of higher dosages of the composition.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, administration of the composition produces greater and/or more prolonged therapeutic effects than the individual moieties that make up the compound.  For example, administration of a conjugate compound comprising aspirin and
gingerol may have a more pronounced anti-tumorigenesis effect than administration of aspirin and gingerol (and/or administration of an aspirin derivative/analog and a gingerol derivative/analog).  Accordingly, methods of the present invention may achieve
adequate levels of anti-tumor efficacy at a lower dosage than would be required for administration of the individual moieties that make up the compound.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that the specific dosage level for any particular subject will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the composition being administered; the age, body weight, general health, sex and
diet of the subject; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; and other drugs which have previously been administered.
<BR><BR> Convenient dosing includes, but is not limited to, a once a day or twice a day administration, such as a tablet or capsule, as well as intravenous infusions.  The use of time-release preparations to control the rate of release of the compound of
the present invention as well as continuous infusions may also be employed.  The dose may be administered in as many divided doses as is convenient.
<BR><BR> Unit dosage formulations can be those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of a composition of the present invention.  The unit dose may be for oral consumption, such as by a tablet or capsule, or
for infusion, or administered by other means as disclosed herein.  In some embodiments, the dose amount is provided once a day, twice a day, 3 times a day, or 4 or more times a day.  In other embodiments, the dose amount is provided twice a week, once a
week, twice a month or once a month.  For example, a dose can be provided twice a day, 3 times a day, or 4 or more times a day.  In some embodiments, such a dose is provided twice a week, once a week, twice a month or once a month.  The amount may be
provided by oral consumption, infusion, or administered by other means familiar to those of skill in the art, such as transdermal or transmucosal.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the unit dose may be provided as an infusion.  For example, the compositions described herein can be administered intravenously, such as by an IV drip using IV solutions well known in the art (e.g., isotonic saline (0.9%
NaCl) or dextrose solution (e.g., 5% dextrose), optionally the intravenous solution further includes preservatives, e.g. Sodium metabisulfite.  For example, a dose can be provided by infusion, such as by IV drip once a day, twice a week, once a week,

<BR><BR>Effect of Aspirin-Stilbene Derivative Compounds on Colon Cancer Cell Lines
<BR><BR> The effects of the aspirin-stilbene derivative conjugates compared to standards were evaluated based on the inhibition of growth of HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells.  Cells were plated in 96-well plates in growth medium with 10% FBS. 
After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing test agent with desired final concentration (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 .mu.M), and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Viable cells were analyzed using the MTT assay, and the results are shown
(FIG. 1) relative to control.  Each value represents the mean.+-.S.D.  (n=8).  FIG. 1A summarizes the results for aspirin (As), Res, RAS, RAS-1, and the combination of resveratrol and aspirin (Res+As).  RAS had a stronger growth inhibitory effect than
resveratrol and aspirin alone, and stronger than the combination of resveratrol and aspirin (1:1) on both HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells (FIG. 1A).  FIG. 1B summarizes the results for As, MRes, MRAS and the combination of MRes and aspirin
(MRes+As).  MRAS had weaker growth inhibitory effects than MRes and the combination of MRes and aspirin (1:1).  FIG. 1C summarizes the results for As, Pt, PAS, and the combination of pterostilbene and aspirin (Pt+As).  PAS had weaker growth inhibitory
effects than pterostilbene and the combination of pterostilbene and aspirin (1:1).  In addition, RAS had much stronger growth inhibitory effects than RAS-1, MRAS, and PAS.

growth medium with 10% FBS.  After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing test agent with desired final concentration (5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 .mu.M), and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Viable cells were analyzed using the MTT
assay, and the results are shown relative to control (FIG. 2).
<BR><BR> SAS had a stronger growth inhibitory effect than aspirin alone, but less effective than 6-shogaol alone and the combination of 6-shogaol and aspirin (1:1) on all cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, and H-1299) (FIG. 2; each value represents the
mean.+-.standard deviation (n=8)).
<BR><BR>Example 8
<BR><BR>Effect of Aspirin-Gingerol Compounds on Colon Cancer Cell Lines
<BR><BR> The effects of As, 6-gingerol (6g), GAS, and the combination of 6-gingerol and aspirin (6g+As) on the growth of HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells and H1299 human lung cancer cells were measured.  Cells were plated in 96-well plates in
growth medium with 10% FBS.  After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing test agent with desired final concentration (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 .mu.M), and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Viable cells were analyzed using the MTT
assay, and the results are shown relative to control (FIG. 3).
<BR><BR> GAS had a much stronger growth inhibitory effect than 6-gingerol and aspirin alone, as well as the combination of 6-gingerol and aspirin (1:1) on all cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, and H-1299) (FIG. 3; each value represents the mean.+-.standard
deviation (n=8).
<BR><BR>Example 9
<BR><BR>Effect of Aspirin-Resveratrol Compounds on Colon Cancer Cell Lines
<BR><BR> The effects of the combination of aspirin and resveratrol (A/R), RAS, RAS-1, 131 and 152 on colony formation of HCT-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cells were measured.  HCT-116 (100 cells/well) and HT-29 (100 cells/well) cells were seeded in
six-well plates.  After 24 h, cells were treated with various concentrations (20, 40, and 60 M) of the test compound.  After 14 days of culture, media were removed and colonies were washed with PBS.  Colonies were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet
for 30 min. After thorough rinsing with PBS, the colonies were counted and recorded.  FIG. 4 shows the anti-cell proliferation effect of the test agents using a colony formation assay.
<BR><BR>Example 10
<BR><BR>Urinary Metabolic Profile of PAS and RAS in Mice
<BR><BR> The metabolic profile of Pt using LC/MS 23 was investigated.  PAS was administered to mice (n=5) by oral gavage (200 mg/kg), and urine samples were collected in metabolism cages for 24 h after administration of vehicle (control mice) or PAS. 
LC/MS methods were developed to analyze PAS, pterostilbene, and aspirin.  LC chromatograms of urine samples collected from PAS-treated mice obtained using positive APCI-MS interface (FIG. 5): (A) before and (B) after enzymatic hydrolysis (treated with
P-glucuronidase and sulfatase); using negative ESI-MS interface: (C) before and (D) after enzymatic hydrolysis.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 5, Peak 1: salicylic acid; peak 2: salicylic acid glucuronide; peak 3: pterostilbene; peak 4: pterostilbene glucuronide; peak 5: pterostilbene sulfate; peak 6: mono-demethylated pterostilbene; peak 7: mono-demethylated
pterostilbene glucuronide; peak 8: mono-demethylated pterostilbene sulfate; peak 9: mono-hydroxylated pterostilbene; and peak 10: mono-hydroxylated pterostilbene glucuronide.
<BR><BR> PAS had the highest response under positive APCI/MS mode, and aspirin and salicylic acid had the highest response under negative ESIMS mode.  Both positive APCI/MS and negative ESI/MS modes are sensitive to pterostilbene.  However, aspirin and
salicylic acid are hardly detectable under positive APCI/MS mode, and PAS is not detectable under negative ESI/MS mode.  Therefore, APCI/MS positive mode was used to analyze PAS, pterostilbene, and their metabolites, and ESI/MS negative mode was used to
analyze aspirin, pterostilbene, and their metabolites.  PAS was hydrolyzed in mice to generate metabolites of aspirin and pterostilbene; neither PAS nor its deacetylated metabolites were detected.
<BR><BR> Using the same experimental conditions, RAS has also been shown to be hydrolyzed in human colon cancer cells (HCT-116 and HT-29) to generate resveratrol and aspirin.  Generally aspirin-stilbene derivative conjugates can be hydrolyzed and are
effective prodrugs of both aspirin and the stilbene derivatives.
<BR><BR>Example 11
<BR><BR>Xenograft Study
<BR><BR> 8 week old animals are randomized into 4 groups based on treatment (DMSO: n=7; RAS 50 mg/kg: n=7; RAS 100 mg/kg: n=7; R+As (resveratrol+aspirin in 1:1 molar ratio equivalent to 50 mg/kg RAS): n=7).  Animals are implanted with 2.times.10.sup.6
HCT-116 cells on each flank.  Starting one week post implantation, animals receive their respective treatments through oral gavage (1001 in corn oil and 5% DMSO), 7.times./week for up to 3 weeks.  Tumor volume is measured every other day during treatment
regimen.  At no more than 3 weeks of treatment, animal are sacrificed.  The tumors are weighed and evaluated for biomarker analysis, bioavailability and histological analysis.
