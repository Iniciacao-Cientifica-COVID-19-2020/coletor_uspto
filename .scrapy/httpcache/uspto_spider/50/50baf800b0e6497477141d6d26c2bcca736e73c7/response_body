0900622.2, filed Jan.  15, 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> This invention relates to a method and means, including parts thereof, for diagnosing urticaria and angioedema using an artificial neural network (ANN).  The invention involves obtaining information about a patient, based on asking the patient a
series of selected questions and carrying out a number of selected tests, inputting this information into a neural network, and obtaining a preliminary diagnosis.  The invention applies equally to adults and children.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Allergies currently affect approximately 34% of the general population (Linneberg 2000).  Whilst at one extreme serious conditions such as anaphylaxis can be life threatening, most allergic disorders pose little risk of death.  However, diseases
such as urticaria and angioedema cause distress and misery for millions of patents, often at times in their lives when they should be most active (Holgate and Broide 2003).  Urticaria (or hives) is a skin rash which occurs in the upper dermis. 
Angioedema (also known as Quincke's edema) is a swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues.  Allergic diseases are a significant cause of morbidity in modern society, adversely affecting sleep, intellectual functioning and
recreational activities.  Furthermore, allergic diseases exert a profoundly negative impact on occupational performance and have major public health costs.
<BR><BR> Across the United Kingdom, waiting times for specialist allergy consultations following referral from primary care are long.
<BR><BR> The rising prevalence of allergies and the associated demand for specialist services suggest that waiting times will inevitably lengthen over the course of the next decade.  Given that there is currently an acute shortage of Immunologists and
Allergists in the UK and worldwide, it seems unlikely that sufficient medical manpower will emerge in the foreseeable future to deal with this increasing demand.
<BR><BR> Recent in-house research has centred on the role of the Allergy Nurse Practitioner in the diagnosis and management of allergic disease.  Increasing use of the Nurse Practitioner in a diagnostic role would enable waiting times to be shortened and
new patient referrals to be seen without the presence of the Consultant Clinical Immunologist.  Whilst Nurse Practitioner-based diagnosis and management strategies should, in time, ameliorate the critical situation, a parallel increase in demand for
allergy services will, without doubt, limit the positive effects on waiting times.  There therefore remains a need to develop further innovative methods to facilitate access of patients to clinical diagnostic services.
<BR><BR> However, as one would expect, it is extremely important that any new methods of diagnosis are accurate if they are to be adopted by the medical community at large.  These methods must be able to replicate, it not exceed, the accuracy of an
experienced Clinical Immunologist.  This is a difficult task to achieve because a Clinical Immunologist uses information from a vast number of sources when reaching a diagnosis.
<BR><BR> Typically, when diagnosing a condition, a medical practitioner will integrate information from several sources, such as a medical history, a physical examination, the results of clinical tests, and by asking the patient about his/her condition. 
The medical practitioner will use judgement based on experience and intuition, both when deciding what to look for and in analysing the information, in order to come to a particular diagnosis.
<BR><BR> Thus, the process of diagnosis involves a combination of knowledge, intuition and experience that leads a medical practitioner to ask certain questions and carry out particular clinical tests, and the validity of the diagnosis is very dependent
upon these factors.
<BR><BR> Given the predictive and intuitive nature of medical diagnosis, and the fact that specialist, experienced medical practitioners are in demand, we have attempted to replicate the diagnostic process in an automated system, in order to give a wider
audience access to this service.  We have found that artificial neural networks (ANNs) have characteristics that make them particularly well suited for this purpose.
<BR><BR> ANNs are computational mathematical modelling tools for information processing and may be defined as `structures comprised of densely interconnected adaptive processing elements (nodes) that are capable of performing massively parallel
computations for data processing and knowledge representation` (Hecht-Nielsen 1990; Schalkoff 1977).  Single artificial neurons for the computation of arithmetic and logical functions were first described by McCulloh and Pitts (1943); fifteen years later
Rosenblatt (1958) described the first successful neurocomputer (the Mark 1 Perceptron).  This simple network consisted of two layers of neurons connected by a single layer of weighted links and was capable of solving problems in a way analogous to
information processing in the human brain (Wei et al 1998; Basheer and Hajmeer 2000).  These early structures were however unable to predict generalised solutions for complex non-linear problems.  Over the course of the following five decades complexity
has increased with the development of multiple networked perceptrons; such advances have led to the application of ANNs to a colossal number of problems, and by 1994 more than 50 different types of network were in existence (Pham 1994 and Basheer and
Hajmeer 2000), each possessing unique properties enabling them to solve particular tasks.
<BR><BR> Such ANNs are capable of dealing with non-linear data, fault and failure, high parallelism and imprecise and fuzzy information (Wei et al 1998).  Neural networks have been shown to be capable of modelling complex real-world problems and found
extensive acceptance in many scientific disciplines (Callan 1999).  The decision as to which type of ANN should be utilised for a particular task depends on problem logistics, input type, and the execution speed of the trained network (Basheer and
Hajmeer 2000).
<BR><BR> Neural networks have found increasing application in a range of clinical settings where they have produced accurate and generalised solutions compared to traditional statistical methodology (reviewed Baxt 1995, Wei et al 1998, Dybowski and Gant
2001).  For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,678,669 discloses using an ANN to diagnose endometriosis, predicting pregnancy related events, such as the likelihood of delivery within a particular time period, and other such disorders relevant to women's health.
<BR><BR> The most commonly used ANN in such studies is the Backpropagational Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).  MLPs are particularly useful in solving pattern classification problems (Wei et al 1998; Basheer and Hajmeer, 2000), which are common in the
clinical arena.  In this context the ANN looks for patterns in a similar way to learning in the human mind; the more a particular pattern is represented, the stronger the recognition of it by the network.
<BR><BR> We have developed a method of diagnosing urticaria and angioedema using a neural network.  In particular, from the vast amount of information that a clinician would have available, we have identified a manageable set of questions and tests that
have clinical significance, and can be used to train a neural network to diagnose urticaria and angioedema, and by inputting the results of these questions and tests into a neural network thus trained the network to produce a diagnosis.
<BR><BR> Surprisingly, we have found that a small set of just 5 inputs to the neural network have a profound influence on the provision of an accurate diagnosis.  The 5 inputs are generated by asking a patient 4 questions and carrying out 1 medical test,
and are referred to herein as the 5-input model.
<BR><BR> We have also identified a set of 14 (13 questions and 1 test), 15 (13 questions and 2 tests) 17 (14 questions and 3 tests), 21 (16 questions and 5 tests), 25 (20 questions and 5 tests), 35 (23 questions and 12 tests), 54 (36 questions and 17
tests), and 79 (42 questions and 36 tests) inputs, referred to herein as the 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 35, 54 and 79 input models respectively, that can be input into a neural network to obtain a diagnosis.
<BR><BR> The identification of these clinically significant questions and tests will mean that a neural network can be trained to diagnose urticaria or angioedema in considerably less time than it currently takes a consultant, which in turn will save
time and money.
<BR><BR> Additionally, a neural network offers an easy-to-use means of diagnosis, both for clinicians and non-clinicians, and will allow central aspects of diagnosis and management to be performed electronically in a way that is accessible to systematic
audit and reduce inequalities in accessing allergy services, via the use of remote electronic information transfer.
<BR><BR> For the avoidance of doubt, any reference herein to a neural network is a reference to an artificial neural network (ANN).

<BR><BR> This is referred to as a 54-input model.
<BR><BR> The question `how long do rash patches last for` may be coded for a yes/no answer.  For example, whether the patches last for longer or shorter than a defined period of time, such as 24 hours.

<BR><BR> Generally, the results of the tests under part (b) are provided as quantitative results.  The quantitative results may relate to the amount of allergen-specific IgE antibodies present.  The results of the tests under part (b) above may be
provided with a graded result and so represent an incremental unit indicative of the nature of the response.  Alternatively, the results may represent a measure of a unit from a continuous scale, such as kilo units of allergen-specific IgE antibodies per
litre.
<BR><BR> Grass and tree pollens referred to herein may be selected having regard to the geographical region in which the patient lives.  For example, in the UK, one would test for mixed grass pollens whereas in North America one is much more likely to
include ragweed and in Northern Europe a test for tree pollen is likely to includes a test for tree birch.  As will be apparent to the man skilled in the art the geographically representative allergens are well known in each geographical region and would
be selected on the basis that in each region the selected allergens are known to elicit an allergic reaction of the upper respiratory tract.
<BR><BR> The RAST test is undertaken using an antibody that is labelled with a suitable label such as a radio-label, although light emitting labels may be used as an alternative, and conventional techniques are used in order to measure the patient's
immune status.  RAST tests, and variations thereof, are well known to those skilled in the art and indeed have been performed for many decades.  The original disclosure concerning diagnosis of an allergy by an in vitro test for allergen antibodies was
described by Wide et al in 1967 and has further been assessed by Thomson & Bird, 1983.
<BR><BR> In some cases it may be useful to save results for analysis at a later time, for example if they cannot be obtained simultaneously.  In this instance the results may be stored on a computer system and applied to a neural network subsequently.
<BR><BR> In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer system or apparatus, configured to aid in the diagnosis of urticaria or angioedema, including: (a) a device for obtaining data relating to a patient, wherein the data includes the
results of a combination of questions and tests outlined in the first aspect of the invention; (b) optionally, a device for storing the data in storage means of the computer system; (c) a device for transferring the data to a neural network trained on
samples of the data; and (d) a device for extracting from the trained neural network an output, the output being an indicator for the diagnosis of urticaria or angioedema.

<BR><BR> As will be appreciated, this aspect of the invention may also be adapted so that the computer is linked to an intranet or Internet with a neural network, thereby allowing patients and/or medical practitioners to input information from remote
locations and obtain a preliminary diagnosis.
<BR><BR> According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a neural network to aid in the diagnosis of urticaria or angioedema, the neural network including: an input layer having a plurality of input nodes into which can be inputted data
which include the results of a combination of questions and tests outlined in the first aspect of the invention; and an output layer for producing an output; in which the neural network is trained on data relating to a group of patients in which
urticaria or angioedema is present, wherein the data include said results of said combination of questions and tests according to the first aspect of the invention; so that the neural network is configured to identity a pattern of data which corresponds
to urticaria or angioedema by the output layer producing an output indicative of the diagnosis of urticaria or angioedema.
<BR><BR> The neural network may be present on a computer or computer system.  The neural network may be present on a server so that it can be accessed remotely.
<BR><BR> The results of any of the 5-, 14-, 15-, 17-, 21-, 25-, 35-, 54- and 79-input models, or any selected combination thereof, may also be used to train a neural network to diagnose a condition.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, in a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for training a neural network to aid in diagnosing urticaria or angioedema, including: a) obtaining data relating to a group of patients in which urticaria or
angioedema is known, wherein the data include a combination of the results of the questions and tests outlined in the first aspect of the invention; (b) training a neural network to identify a pattern of data which corresponds to urticaria or angioedema;
and (c) storing the neural network in storage means of a computer or on a computer-readable medium.
<BR><BR> A neural network may also be trained using other methods, which methods will be apparent to a man skilled in the art.
<BR><BR> The invention further comprises a computer or a computer system comprising at least one neural network embodying any one or more of the aforementioned models or methods for the purposes of performing a diagnosis.
<BR><BR> The invention further comprises at least one neural network that has been trained for diagnosis using data from the 5-, 14-, 15-, 17-, 21-, 25-, 35-, 54- or 79-input models.  Such a neural network may be sold separately, or put on a server so
that it can be accessed remotely.
<BR><BR> Yet further, the invention comprises a data carrier comprising the aforementioned methodology of the invention and/or a software interface for enabling a user to communicate with a neural network trained for the diagnostic purpose of the
invention.

<BR><BR> Methods Ethical Considerations
<BR><BR> Bro Taf Local Research Ethics Committee granted ethical approval for all aspects of this study and the project was registered with Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust Research and Development Office.  All participants were required to complete a consent
form.  Data were anonymised prior to analysis and handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
<BR><BR> Structured Questionnaire Design
<BR><BR> This study made use of a standard questionnaire comprising questions and tests were created using the commercial Cardiff TELEform information capture system v7.0 Designer module.  This questionnaire was devised as an integral part of the Nurse
Practitioner-based diagnosis and management evaluation program and aimed to gather demographic and clinical information in a structured format.  This questionnaire was endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts and piloted in WCAS clinics
throughout 2001.
<BR><BR> Patient Recruitment and Data Collection
<BR><BR> Data were gathered during 2004.  Patients aged 18 to 75 referred to the WCAS by General Practitioners or hospital doctors due to symptoms of urticaria or angioedema were drawn from the routine non-urgent outpatient waiting list and recruited
using an approved protocol.  All consenting patients with predominant presenting symptoms of urticaria or angioedema were entered into the study.  There were no exclusion criteria.  Participants underwent Skin Prick Testing immediately prior to an
initial conventional consultation with either the Consultant Clinical Immunologist or Allergy Nurse Practitioner.  The order of consultation was randomized so that roughly equal numbers of patients were seen first by the Nurse Practitioner as by the
Consultation Clinical Immunologist.  Findings were recorded on the standard questionnaire ensuring all sections were fully completed.  Patients were then seen independently by the other practitioner, and findings annotated upon a separate questionnaire. 
Total serum IgE and RAST testing were performed upon clinical discretion.  As per current WCAS protocol, a clinic letter outlining the final diagnosis and management plan was dictated by the Consultant Clinical Immunologist and posted to the referring
medical practitioner and patient.  A similar letter was dictated independently by the Allergy Nurse Practitioner, which was retained as supporting evidence to her questionnaire, for analysis in a later study.
<BR><BR> Data Transfer
<BR><BR> Once available, all RAST and other test results were added to data recorded during respective consultations.  Completed questionnaires were processed using the commercial Cardiff TELEform information capture system v8.2 Scan station, Reader and
Verifier modules (see FIG. 1).  Data were exported into separate Microsoft Excel files for each clinician.
<BR><BR> Data Preprocessing and Normalisation
<BR><BR> Data imported into Microsoft Excel were anonymised.  All input variables were inspected for transfer accuracy and errors corrected manually.  Data were normalised (scaled) within a uniform range for each input variable, some variables removed
(e.g. domestic demographic data, ethnic origin and marital status) and a number of new input variables created following recoding of defined input groups.  The final aetiological diagnosis for each patient was coded into one of five output categories
(chronic idiopathic urticaria/angioedema, physical urticaria, aspiring-included urticaria, non-aspirin drug induced urticaria/angioedema, and urticaria after unidentified food additives).
<BR><BR> Data Partitioning
<BR><BR> Data were partitioned into two separate Excel parent databases (i.e. separate Excel worksheets) (i) `all questionnaire inputs` and (ii) `clinically selected inputs` (79 input variables; five output variables) (see Table 2), as it became
available.  ANN models were developed using data and diagnoses from the Consultant Clinical Immunologist.  Model development required data from each parent database to be divided into two subsets: (i) training and test data and (ii) validation.

<BR><BR> At present there are no mathematical rules governing the required size of data subsets and most ANN-based studies utilize anecdotal rules derived from experience and analogy with statistical regression techniques (Basheer and Hajmeer et al
2000).  Table 3 shows the allocation of the total (108 patients) data set into training and test data subsets.  Data utilised for the ANN training subset for both parent databases were drawn from patients 001-073 since these were collected first, and
data from patients 074-108 were used as test data.

<BR><BR> Balancing of Training and Test Subset Data
<BR><BR> It is desirable that data used in ANN training is nearly evenly distributed between output categories to prevent the ANN model generated from being biased to over-represented output classes (Swingler 1996).  Table 3 shows the distribution of
diagnoses amongst patients 001-074.  Traditional approaches to dealing with such unbalanced data include removing examples from over-represented output classes or adding examples pertaining to under-represented classes (Basheer and Hajmeer 2000).  The
relatively small size of the training and test data subsets made the first option undesirable.  Furthermore, whilst there is no published epidemiological data with which to compare the distribution of diagnoses in the training data subset, it seemed
unlikely that significant numbers of under-represented diagnoses would be made.  It was therefore decided to use unbalanced training and test data on the premise that models created would reflect what appeared to be a real-world bias to allergic and
allergic angioedema in patients presenting to the WCAS.
<BR><BR> Optimisation of ANN Architecture
<BR><BR> The study used a commercially available ANN, the Neuroshell Predictor.TM.  (Ward Systems Inc, Frederick, Md., USA).  Neuroshell Predictor.TM.  can operate in one of two modes.  In the neural mode of analysis, the neural net that dynamically
grows hidden neurons to build a model which generalises well and trains quickly.  A variation of the Cascade Correlation algorithm is utilised.  When applying the trained network to new data, the Neural Training Strategy may enable better results to be
obtained on "noisy data" that is somewhat dissimilar from the data used to train the network.
<BR><BR> Alternatively, the Neuroshell Predictor.TM.  can be used in a genetic mode of analysis.  A genetic algorithm is utilised, which is a variant of the General regression neural network (GRNN).  The genetic training strategy trains slowly.  When
applying the trained network to new data, the genetic training strategy gets better results when the new data is similar to the training data.  It also works better when the training data is sparse.

<BR><BR> Data Analysis with View to Optimising Data Input and Diagnosis
<BR><BR> The information shown in Tables 4 and 5, and FIGS. 2 and 3 demonstrates that the commercially available product Neuroshell Predictor.TM.  can be used to produce an ANN that is capable of performing a clinical diagnosis.  However, further data
analysis is needed in order to determine the optimum number of reliable data inputs needed to obtain an acceptable tool for diagnosis.  Accordingly, the number and combination of data inputs was progressively reduced and varied, respectively, with a view
to determining a preferred number and nature of inputs for producing a reliable diagnosis.  This process partly involved an analysis of the relative importance of inputs into the ANN, and also utilised clinical experience and judgement.  Table 2 shows,
in addition to the 79-input model, 54-, 35-, 25-, 21-, 17-, 15-, 14- and 9-input models obtained by using 54, 35, 25, 21, 17, 15, 14 and 9 data inputs, respectively.  Using each input model, and each mode of operation of the ANN, data was obtained
concerning the ANN reliability of diagnosis vis a vis use of clinical analysis.

<BR><BR> Table 7 shows the mean sensitivities and specificities across all five output diagnostic categories as a function of the number of input fields utilised.  The results are shown separately for the ANN trained in the neural mode of analysis, in
the genetic mode of analysis when trained to minimise the average number of incorrect classifications over all categories and in the genetic mode of analysis when trained to minimise the total number of incorrect classifications.  Tables 8-10 show
sensitivities and specificities across the five output diagnostic categories for the 14-input model for the differently trained ANNs.  It can be seen that the reduced inputs set of 14 to 54 inputs provide good or excellent categorisation of
urticaria/angioedema by aetiological cause.  The 14 inputs were reduced to 9 inputs by eliminating the following 5 inputs from the analysis: 1.  Taking NSAID or Aspirin 2.  Symptoms triggered by Aspirin, aspirin-containing drugs, orange juice, curry or
high-aspirin content food 3.  The presence and amount of IgE antibodies against Cat in a RAST test 4.  Tingling of the mouth/lips, swelling of the tongue, inside mouth, throat or difficulty swallowing or breathing after other medications than those known
to cause urticaria or angioedema 5.  Urticaria coming on with physical stimuli of cold, wet, wind, pressure etc.
<BR><BR> However, it was found that the removal of these 5 inputs resulted in a marked degradation of the ANN's performance, with sensitivities falling to 50% or below.  From this it was inferred that a meaningful classification of urticaria/angioedema
by aetiological cause should utilise an input data set which includes these five inputs.  Of course, other inputs may be included as well.  The removal of other combinations of 5 inputs from the 14-input model did not result in such a marked degradation
in ANN performance.
<BR><BR> Other forms of neural network and trained methodologies might be employed.  For example, it may be desirable to analyse the data in a series of steps.  For instance, an initial, broad diagnosis might be provided, with more detailed
classifications into specific aetiological causes being provided in one or more further steps.  A different and/or differently trained neural network may be used for a subsequent step, and a different subset of questions and/or test results might be used
in order to make the more refined diagnosis.
