<BR><BR>This application is closely related to my co-pending application titled, "METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF A POTASSIUM AND ASPIRIN COMBINATION COMPOUND" which is being filed concurrently herewith.  The teachings of this co-pending application are
incorporated herein by reference thereto.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates, in general, to pain relieving and/or antacid type compounds and, more particularly, this invention relates to a new and improved alkaline and aspirin combination compound which when mixed together is readily soluble
in a predetermined fluid, such as water, and when dissolved form potassium acetylsalicylate and, still more particularly, this invention relates to such an alkaline and aspirin combination compound which is faster acting than previously known and/or used
aspirin compounds and that can be an effective antacid.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Prior to the present invention, aspirin and the use thereof as a suitable treatment for the temporary relief of minor aches and pain has been well established for many years.  In fact, aspirin is the most commonly used pain relief medication on
the market.
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, however, the aspirin products which are currently available on the market have very poor solubility in water or any other fluid suitable for human consumption.  In addition, it is well known that aspirin is an acidic drug which can
cause gastric distress.  Such gastric distress is caused primarily because the aspirin particles do not dissolve and such particles attach to the walls of the stomach and/or intestines.
<BR><BR>Equally well known today is the significant role which aspirin may have in the successful treatment and management of two of the most common major diseases that afflicts the world's population, i.e. arthritis and heart attacks.  It has been
demonstrated that aspirin is both an effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.
<BR><BR>In addition, aspirin's beneficial effect on the human immune system may make it a promising drug for possible use in the treatment of cancer, AIDS, cataracts, allergies and a number of other diseases in which the immune system is involved.  These
valuable pharmacological properties have made aspirin the most widely used drug in the world.
<BR><BR>Nevertheless, it has been documented that aspirin does possess a number of undesirable side-effects, although the true severity of these side-effects has not been recognized until recently.  For example, being a sparingly soluble substance (only
0.33 gm in 100 ml of water), the undissolved particles of aspirin will normally adhere to the gastrointestinal mucosa.  Such adherence can cause lesions, gastric and duodenal ulcers and bleeding.  These undesirable side-effects are usually persistent and
cumulative and they occur in a number of patients in which aspirin is used as a therapy.  Gastroscopic and clinical studies, which have been reported in numerous medical journals, confirm the topical nature of these detrimental side-effects.
<BR><BR>The corrosive effects that aspirin may display on the gastrointestinal mucosa were recognized early in the history of aspirin therapy.  Consequently, attempts to produce a soluble form of this drug have been made almost continuously since then. 
See, for example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 740,703 issued in 1903.  These efforts were concentrated almost exclusively on the preparation of various soluble salts, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium as well as with organic amines and amino acids
(lysine and ormthine).
<BR><BR>The main disadvantages of these particular salt products was that, in contrast to the aspirin itself, they were not stable.  Most of these salts will contain water of crystallization which produces an intramolecular hydrolysis that results in the
splitting of the molecule into salicylic and acetic acids.  However, the attempts which have been made to prevent this unwanted decomposition by removing the water and forming an anhydrous salt have resulted in hygroscopic products which are not only
difficult to handle and expensive to produce, but require special expensive moisture-proof packaging of each individual dose.
<BR><BR>The cost of such products was so high that they could not successfully compete with aspirin in the marketplace.  In addition, the use of these prior art salt products will often involve the ingestion of undesirably high amounts of metallic
elements.
<BR><BR>More recently, attempts have been made to eliminate these disadvantages and detrimental side-effects by a more simple and generally less expensive means.  Thus, aspirin tablets were coated with layers of buffering agents that are designed to
neutralize the gastric acidity.  Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, sodium aluminum carbonate, sodium aluminum glycinate and the like, are thus in use in a number of commercial aspirin products.
<BR><BR>Clinical studies show that these methods are not entirely effective, partly because it is not possible to coat an aspirin tablet with a sufficient amount of a buffering agent to totally neutralize the gastric acid.  Even if it were possible to do
so, there is an immediate natural response of the human body which may cause the production of more acid, often in larger amounts than originally present (acid rebound).
<BR><BR>Even more importantly, however, is the fact that the use of such buffering agents does not prevent the detrimental insoluble particles of aspirin from adhering to the gastro-intestinal mucosa and causing corrosion.  Another known prior art method
used in commercial tablets is to enteric-coat them.  Such coating is designed to prevent the aspirin release in the stomach and to exert its effect in the intestine.  This, however, simply results in shifting the focus of the undesirable side-effects
from the stomach to the intestine.
<BR><BR>As mentioned above, the manufacture of soluble salts of aspirin is highly complicated and quite costly.  A typical example is the manufacture of the sodium salt of aspirin as disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,985,792.
<BR><BR>The first step of this patented process involves the reacting of aspirin with sodium bicarbonate in water, which forms a solution of the sodium salt.  In the second step, this solution is treated with isopropanol and cooled to 5.degree.  C.,
which causes the crystallization of sodium acetylsalicylate dihydrate.  The third step involves the filtration and washing of the dihydrate.  In the fourth step, the dihydrate, which is unstable, is dehydrated as soon as possible in a vacuum dryer or in
a current of dry, inert gas, such as nitrogen.  The final product is hygroscopic and must be handled, stored and packaged in humidity-controlled rooms.
<BR><BR>Finally, isopropanol which is used in large amounts (10 lbs.  per lb.  of product) must be separated from water and recovered by fractional distillation.  This involved process is even further complicated by the fact that the aspirin is
decomposed by water and by isopropanol, which affects the yield, the purity and the stability of the final product.
<BR><BR>It is generally well recognized, in the drug art, that aspirin will readily react with sodium bicarbonate to form an aqueous solution of the sodium salt.  Therefore, it would seem logical that the costly and complicated preparation of the sodium
salt could be avoided by simply adding the aspirin to the sodium bicarbonate, in premeasured amounts corresponding to the desired dose, to a glass of water, stirring the mixture until the aspirin is dissolved and drinking the solution.
<BR><BR>This method would provide an aspirin solution simply and inexpensively, which is free of corrosion-causing insoluble particles to patients on aspirin therapy.  And, indeed, such products are commercially available, usually in the form of
effervescent tablets containing a mixture of aspirin, sodium bicarbonate and citric acid.
<BR><BR>The major drawback of these products is that in order to accomplish such dissolution, with respect to even the smallest adult dose of aspirin (325 mg.  5 grains), it was found necessary to use large amounts of sodium bicarbonate (1900 mg.), which
represents a very large excess, since the theoretical amounts needed is on the order of 152 mg.  Even allowing for the fact that some of the sodium bicarbonate may be neutralized by the citric acid, the amount of the bicarbonate present is still
equivalent to nearly 40 moles when only one mole is required for the reaction.
<BR><BR>Aspirin when used for chronic pain and arthritis is usually taken in dosages of two tablets at a time, 325 mg.  each, six times a day.  The use of these commercially available prior art effervescent aspirin tablets described above would, while
giving particle-free solutions of aspirin, involve the ingestion of about 7,000 mg.  of elemental sodium per day.  This amount of sodium is considered medically detrimental to a person's health in general, but particularly to older patients, and patients
with hypertension.
<BR><BR>As a result, these products are used only for the relief of occasional minor pain or an upset stomach.  They should never be used on a regular basis by patients with arthritis or those on restricted sodium diets.
<BR><BR>In the laboratory, or during industrial manufacture, as was disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,157,030, the amount of sodium bicarbonate used is 46.7 parts per 100 parts of aspirin, whereas in the soluble aspirin tablet as described above, the amount
is 1,250 parts, or more than about 20 times larger.  The primary reason why it is necessary to use such large detrimental amounts of sodium bicarbonate, in commercially available effervescent tablets, can generally be explained by the kinetics of the
reaction involved.
<BR><BR>In the preparation of sodium aspirin, whether in the laboratory or on an industrial scale, the amount of water used is as small as practically possible.  Thus, for 100 parts of aspirin and 46.7 parts of sodium bicarbonate, the amount of water
required is about 50 parts.  Therefore, the amount of aspirin is about 50% of the total, the amount of the sodium bicarbonate is about 25% and the amount of water is 25% also.
<BR><BR>The purpose of using such high concentrations is to utilize the equipment capacity to its maximum, to produce the maximum yield on crystallization and to use the smallest amount of the solvent.  Also, the use of high concentrations causes the
reaction to be completed in a shorter period of time, since the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants.
<BR><BR>The concentration of both reactants varies constantly as the reaction proceeds.  The initial concentration of aspirin is low because of its low solubility, whereas that of the more soluble sodium bicarbonate is about 33%.
<BR><BR>The situation is quite different when the use of single doses by individual patients is considered.  Aspirin tablets are generally taken with about a half-glass of water (about 100 to 120 ml or about 31/2 to 4 oz.).  While the concentration of
aspirin is the same in any amount of water, its value being determined by its solubility in water (0.33%) and is thus constant.  The concentration of sodium bicarbonate can be varied as desired within relatively wide limits.  However, if one wishes to
use it in equimolecular proportions, a 325 mg dose of aspirin will require 152 mg of sodium bicarbonate to produce a solution.
<BR><BR>If this dose is taken in 100 ml of water, the concentration of sodium bicarbonate will be, initially, 0.152% and will decrease as the reaction progresses.  Thus, concentration values in the laboratory or the plant, on the one hand, and in
personal usage on the other hand, are 33% vs 0.15%.
<BR><BR>In order to bring the rate of the reaction within more practical limits, and since it is not possible to increase the concentration of aspirin, the only alternative has been to increase the concentration of undesirable sodium well beyond the
stoichiometric proportions.  As pointed out, the sodium content of such soluble aspirin products is so high as to make them unsuitable for most of the major applications of aspirin in medicine.
<BR><BR>The influence of sodium bicarbonate concentrations on it's rate of reaction with aspirin was determined by stirring 325 mg of aspirin with variable amounts of sodium bicarbonate in 100 ml of water and recording the time needed for the formation
of a solution.  Aspirin USP mesh #325 was used.  This is the finest particle size available commercially (Monsanto, "micromized").  In order to simulate the conditions of practical use as closely as possible, the mixture was stirred by hand and with a
teaspoon in an 8 oz glass.
<BR><BR>In order to be of practical use to individual patients, a dose of a soluble aspirin product should dissolve in about half a glass of water (100-120 ml; 31/2-4 oz), in a reasonably short time (less than 60 seconds), with stirring by hand with a
spoon.  As mentioned, this is achieved in commercial products by the use of a large excess of sodium bicarbonate.  However, this results in the ingestion of excessive amounts of sodium if the product is to be used on a regular basis.
