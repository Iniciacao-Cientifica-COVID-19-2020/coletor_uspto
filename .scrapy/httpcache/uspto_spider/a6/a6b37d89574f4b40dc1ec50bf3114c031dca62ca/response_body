<BR><BR>The invention is concerned with novel diamines, namely N,N'-bis(quinolin-4-yl)-diamine derivatives of the general formula ##STR2## wherein R.sup.1 signifies halogen or trifluoromethyl, R.sup.2 signifies hydrogen or halogen, A signifies
cyclohexane-1,3-diyl, 2-methyl-cyclohexane-1,3-diyl, cyclohexane-1,4-diyl, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diyl, cyclopentane-1,3-diyl, phenylene-1,4, phenylene-1,3, phenylene-1,2, ethene-1,2-diyl or ethyne-1,2-diyl and n and m can be the same or different and
signify 0, 1 or 2, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
<BR><BR>These novel compounds have very good activities against not only chloroquine-sensitive, but also against chloroquine-resistant malaria pathogens.  For this reason they are very well suited for preventing malaria and for treating it, especially
where the pathogens are resistant to chloroquine.
<BR><BR>Objects of the present invention are the novel bis-quinoline derivatives of general formula I as well as pharmaceutically usable salts thereof per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, the manufacture of these compounds and salts,
medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, the production of such medicaments and the use of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the control or
prevention of illnesses, especially of malaria, and, respectively, for the production of such medicaments.
<BR><BR>In formula I R.sup.1 preferably signifies chlorine, A preferably signifies cyclohexane-1,3-diyl, 2-methyl-cyclohexane-1,3-diyl, cyclohexane-1,4-diyl, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diyl, cyclopentane-1,3-diyl, phenylene-1,4, phenylene-1,3 or
phenylene-1,2 and n and m preferably signify 0 or 1.
<BR><BR>Compounds of formula I in which R.sup.1 signifies chlorine, A signifies ethene-1,2-diyl and n and m signify 1 are also preferred.
<BR><BR>Particularly preferred compounds of general formula I are:
<BR><BR>(7-Chloroquinolin-4-yl)-[2-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl-aminomethyl)-benzyl]-amin e,
<BR><BR>(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-[3-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl-aminomethyl)-benzyl]-amin e

<BR><BR>N,N'-bis-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-2-butene-1,4-diamine.
<BR><BR>The novel compounds of formula I can be manufactured in accordance with the invention by
<BR><BR>a) reacting a compound of the general formula ##STR3## wherein R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 have the significance set forth above and X signifies a leaving group, with a diamine of the general formula
<BR><BR>wherein n, m and A have the significance set forth above, or an acid addition salt thereof, and
<BR><BR>b) if desired, converting the compound obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.
<BR><BR>Bis-quinoline derivatives of general formula I are manufactured according to variant a) of the process in accordance with the invention by reacting a corresponding compound of general formula II with the corresponding diamines of general formula
III.  .alpha.,.alpha.'-Diamino-o-xylene, .alpha.,.alpha.'-diamino-m-xylene, .alpha.,.alpha.'-diamino-p-xylene, .+-.-trans-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine, cis-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine, cis-cyclohexane-1,3-diamine, .+-.-trans-cyclohexane-1,3-diamine,
cis,cis-2-methyl-cyclohexane-1,3-diamine, phenylene-1,3-diamine, cis-cyclopentane-l,3-diamine, 1,3-bis-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane, 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexylmethane or trans-2-butene-1,4-diamine can be used, for example, as the diamine.  In place of the
free diamines, their acid addition salts can also be used.
<BR><BR>Suitable compounds of formula II are, for example, 4,7-dichloroquinoline or 4-chloro-7-trifluoromethyl-quinoline.
<BR><BR>The reaction is conveniently effected under a protective gas atmosphere in a temperature range of 100.degree.-200.degree.  C. and in a solvent, with phenol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, ethoxyethanol or acetonitrile being
preferred.  The presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine influences the reaction favourably, but is not essential.  When the acid addition salt of a diamine is used, the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine is required.  The
reaction time can vary between 2 and 28 hours.
<BR><BR>The conversion into a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt according to process variant b) is conveniently effected by adding an acid.  Hydrochloric acid, methanesulphonic acid or acetic acid is especially preferred because of the
physiological compatibility of the corresponding salts.  Convenient solvents which are especially suitable are: water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, diethyl ether, N,N-dimethylformamide or dioxan.
<BR><BR>The diamines and quinoline derivatives which are required as starting materials for process variant a) are commercial products or can be prepared according to methods known per se.
<BR><BR>As mentioned earlier, the bis-quinoline derivatives of general formula I in accordance with the invention and their pharmaceutically usable salts have extremely valuable pharmacological properties.
<BR><BR>The following Tables 1-3 show their activity against not only chloroquine-resistant, but also chloroquine-sensitive malaria pathogens.
<BR><BR>Test Method for the Determination of the Activity Against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro
<BR><BR>The preparations are tested on intraerythrocytary stages of Plasmodium falciparum from asynchronous cultures according to the method of Desjardin et al. (Desjardins, R. E. et al: Quantitative assessment of antimalarial activity in vitro by a
semiautomated microdilution technique.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  16, 710-718, (1979)).
<BR><BR>The culture medium consists of RPMI 1640 with the addition of 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaHCO.sub.3, 100 .mu.g/ml neomycin and 105 human serum (A.sup.+).  Human-A.sup.+ erythrocytes are used as the Plasmodium falciparum host cells.  The parasites are
maintained at 37.degree.  C. in an atmosphere of 3% O.sub.2, 4% CO.sub.2, 9:3% N.sub.2 and 95% relative humidity.
<BR><BR>In order to determine the activity, the preparations are dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide, pre-diluted in the culture medium to a suitable starting concentration and subsequently titrated-out on to microtitre plates in the 2nd stage over 6-7
steps.  After the addition of the parasite culture (0.7% parasitemia in 2.5% erythrocyte suspension) the test plates are incubated under the conditions given above for 48 h-72 h. The parasite growth in the different preparation concentrations is
determined using [G--.sup.3 H]-hypoxanthin incorporation compared to untreated control cultures on the same test plates.  The 50% growth inhibition (IC.sub.50) is calculated according to logit regression analysis from the resulting dosage-activity curve.
<BR><BR>The preparations are tested on at least one chloroquine-resistant and one chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain.  Additional sensitive and resistant strains are included for futher characterization.
<BR><BR>Test Method for the Determination of the Activity Against Plasmodium berghei in vivo
<BR><BR>The preparations are tested on mice infected with malaria pathogens (Plasmodium berghei).  Male albino mice (IBM:MORO(SPF), FUELLINSDORF) weighing about 25 g are used as the test animals.  They are kept in climatized rooms at
21.degree.-22.degree.  C. in groups of 5 animals per cage.  They receive ad libitum a diet feed with a low PABA content (NAFAG FUTTER .COPYRGT.  No. 9009 PAB-45, PABA content 45 mg/kg) and drinking water.  On the first day of the test (DO) the test
animals are infected with Plasmodium berghei (strain ANKA).  For this there is used heparinized blood of a donor mouse with about 30% parasitemia, which is diluted with physiological saline such that it contains 10.sup.8 parasitized erythrocytes per ml. 
0.2 ml of this suspension is injected intravenously (i.v.) into the mice to be treated and into the control mice.  In untreated control animals the parasitemia normally reaches 30-40% on the third day after the infection (D+3) and the test animals die
between days +5 and +7.
<BR><BR>The substances to be tested are dissolved or suspended in distilled water or in a mixture of 7% Tween 80, 3% alcohol (96%) and water.  Usually, 0.25 ml of this solution or suspension is administered once subcutaneously and perorally to groups of
5 test animals.  Treatment is effected 24 hours after the infection.  10 control animals are treated in the same manner with solvent or suspension medium per test.
<BR><BR>All substances are tested in a first test in a single dosage of 10 mg/kg.  Only those substances which in this test (10 mg/kg) have shown a parasitaemia reduction of 90% are used for the titration.  Suitable dilutions of the test substance can be
used to obtain an accurate titration of the activity.
<BR><BR>48 hours after the treatment (D+3) blood smears are prepared from all animals using blood from tail veins and are stained with giemsa.  The average erythrocyte infection rate (parasitemiea in %) in the control groups as well as in the groups
which have been treated with the test compounds is determined by counting under a microscope.  The difference in the average values of the infection rates of control group (100%) and treated groups is calculated and expressed as a percentage reduction
(GI%).  The ED.sub.50 or ED.sub.90 is determined mathematically by means of the JMP programme (nonlinear fit).  The ED.sub.50 (ED.sub.90) in mg/kg is that dose which after single administration reduces the average erythrocyte infection rate by 50% (90%)
in comparison to the control group.

<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.  The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered
orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions.  The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in
the form of injection solutions.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. 
Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.  Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for
example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like.  Depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules.  Suitable carriers for the production of
solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like.  Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. 
They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.
<BR><BR>Medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their manufacture which comprises
bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other thereapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more
therapeutically inert carriers.
<BR><BR>In accordance with the invention compounds of general formula I as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be used for the treatment or prevention of malaria and, respectively, for the production of corresponding
medicaments.  The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case.  In the case of oral administration the dosage lies in a range of about 10 mg to about 2.5 g per day of a compound
of general formula I or the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, although the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.
<BR><BR>In the following Examples, which illustrate the present invention but are not intended to limit its scope in any manner, all temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.  The 250 MHz--.sup.1 H--NMR spectra were measured at room temperature;
