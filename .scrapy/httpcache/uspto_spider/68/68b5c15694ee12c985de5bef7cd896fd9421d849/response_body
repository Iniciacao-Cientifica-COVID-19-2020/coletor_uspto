<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a novel method of administering acetylsalicylic acid, more specifically to a novel intravenous formulation, using a water-soluble cocrystal product of acetylsalicylic acid and theanine that has a neutral pH and
provides enhanced stability and bioactivity as compared to previously known water-soluble formulations of aspirin.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in developed countries.  In the United States, a heart attack occurs approximately every 20 seconds.  Aspirin inhibition of cyclooxygenase has been shown to be beneficial in patients
presenting with acute coronary syndrome and acute myocardial infarction.  Researchers found that the median platelet inhibition times for chewed baby aspirin 324 mg, soluble aspirin (alka-seltzer) 325 mg, and whole compressed non-enteric coated aspirin
324 mg, were 7.5 minutes, 7.5 minutes, and 10.0 minutes, respectively.  Schwertner, et al, "Effects of different aspirin formulations on platelet aggregation times and on plasma salicylate concentration." Thromb Res.  2006; 118(4): 529-34.  Epub 2005
Nov.  18.  Within 7.5 minutes, though, an individual could be dead from one of a number of potentially fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or complete heart block.  Early administration of a novel intravenous
aspirin formulation could start benefitting the patient in a matter of seconds, whereas the full benefit of traditional aspirin may not take effect until major sequelae, complications or death has occurred.  In a person presenting with an acute
myocardial infarction, intravenous aspirin is the preferred route for early platelet aggregation inhibition.  According to the American Heart Association's 2007 National STEMI Statistics, 75% of the nation's acute care hospitals are not capable of
performing life-saving PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) for STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction) patients.  As such, there is a clear unmet need for a novel intravenous aspirin with improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients
presenting with acute myocardial infarction.
<BR><BR> Aspirin inhibits prostanoid biosynthesis, in particular that of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2.  Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) through acetylation of the amino acid serine at position 529,
thereby preventing arachidonic acid access to the COX-1 catalytic site through steric hindrance.  By inhibiting COX-1, the platelet is unable to synthesize prostaglandin H2, which would otherwise be converted to thromboxane A2, which causes platelet
aggregation, an early step in the coagulation cascade.
<BR><BR> Control of the inflammatory process is regulated by a cascade of biomolecular mechanisms.  These mechanisms occur via two pathways: the cyclooxygenase pathway, which results in the formation of prostaglandins, and the lipoxygenase pathway, which
results in the formation of leukotrienes.  Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), like aspirin, function via the cyclooxygenase pathway.  There are three major human lipoxygenases.  They differ in the position of the double bond on the arachidonic
acid molecule.  These human lipoxygenases include the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases, which respectively catalyze the insertion of oxygen at the C-5, C-12 and C-15 positions of arachidonic acid.  The resulting leukotrienes and lipoxins provide signaling
molecules associated with avariety of human diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease.  Leukotrienes and lipoxins, have been implicated as critical signaling molecules in a variety of cancers.  15-HLO has been
shown to be a key biological agent in colorectal cancers, while 12-HLO is involved in pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers.  5-HLO is up-regulated in prostate cancer and its inhibition abolishes all cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis.
<BR><BR> Tylenol accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States and other Western countries.  The hepatotoxicity of Tylenol (acetaminophen), statins (cholesterol lowering drugs), antiretrovirals (taken for HIV and AIDS), and alcohol are well
known.  Researchers at Yale University have now provided new insight into the mechanism by which acetaminophen causes liver damage in mice and determined that aspirin provides substantial protection from these toxic effects of acetaminophen.  Wajahat Z.
Mehal; Acetaminophen--induced hepatotoxicity in mice is dependent on Tlr9 and the Nalp3 Inflammasome; Journal of Clinical Investigation; Jan.  26, 2009.
<BR><BR> Currently, intravenous aspirin is not approved for use in the United States.  The poor solubility of aspirin in water and its rapid hydrolysis in the plasma to salicylic acid and acetic acid have limited its intravenous use.
<BR><BR> Attempts have been made in the past to produce an aspirin product having an acceptable solubility, but none have proven to be totally satisfactory.
<BR><BR> For example, the introduction of Bayer aspirin, as well as Disprin (distributed in the United Kingdom), into water results in the formation of a cloudy suspension indicative of incomplete dissolution in water.  Aspro Clear (distributed in
Australia and New Zealand and marketed throughout Europe) imparts a non-cloudy, snow globe effect in water for more than three minutes after the tablets have effervesced.
<BR><BR> It is well-known that lysine acetylsalicylate (sold as, e.g., Aspegic and Aspisol) is suitable for intravenous administration.  The suitability of lysine for intravenous administration is due to the formation of a salt of acetylsalicylic acid
with a basic amino acid, with the salt form exhibiting improved solubility.  Lysine acetylsalicylate, however, is not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.  See e.g., FDA Reports 2006-2008: Aspegic Side-Effect Report #5076936-8 (after drug
was administered, patient developed cardio-respiratory arrest and ventricular fibrillation and died); FDA Reports 2006-2008: Aspegic Side Effect Report #5379074-X (after drug was administered, patient experienced angina pectoris and recovered).
<BR><BR> U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,665,388 and 5,723,453 to Phykitt, disclose an essentially sodium-free, soluble alkaline aspirin compound.  The formulations disclosed in these references, however, suffer from a number of disadvantages.  One disadvantage is
that the use of bicarbonates, as disclosed therein, causes gas to be formed when ingested by patients.  Another disadvantage is that the relatively high pH of the compositions disclosed therein (i.e., greater than 8.0) leads to rapid hydrolysis and
instability of the drug substance and, therefore, a shortened shelf-life.
<BR><BR> Many of the formulations disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,157,030 and 5,776,431 to Galat are formed as two separate compositions (mixture "A" and mixture "B"), which is disadvantageous from manufacturing, packaging and use standpoints. 
Furthermore, the formulations in these references are blended and then directly added to water.  There is no indication that the blended product is stable.  Further, compositions formulated in accordance with the Galat patents take up to two to three
minutes to substantially completely dissolve in water.
<BR><BR> Compositions formulated in accordance with the methods disclosed in Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0292225 to Felix take up to 15-30 seconds to completely dissolve in water with stirring.
<BR><BR> Theanine, like aspirin, is known to have salutary effects.  It is found in ordinary tea leaves from Camellia sinensis and the mushroom Xerocomus badius, but is otherwise rare in nature.  Preliminary research, suggests that L-theanine promotes
alpha wave generation in the brain.  Thereby, an awake, alert and relaxed physical and mental condition is achieved, which demonstrates theanine's effectiveness in stress management.  L-theanine does not cause drowsiness or impair a person's motor
skills.  It has been shown to work antagonistically against the negative side effects of caffeine, to increase dopamine and serotonin concentrations in the brain, to be effective in reducing the hypertension and disturbance of sleep often associated with
the use of caffeine, and to diminish symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.  Laboratory studies indicate that theanine produces these effects by increasing the level of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.
<BR><BR> It has been reported that theanine supports the immune system and may reduce plasma total cholesterol, cholesterol ester and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
<BR><BR> Studies on the effects of theanine on alcohol metabolism and hepatic toxicity have shown that theanine is effective against alcoholic liver injury.
<BR><BR> Theanine also has the potential to protect neurons from excesses of glutamate.  Glutamate is an essential brain chemical that may be released in excess amounts with some disease conditions (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cerebrovascular
dementia) and with brain injuries, as occurs with strokes or physical injuries.  Theanine may protect against this damage by blocking glutamine entrance to cells due to the similarity in the stereochemical structures of theanine and glutamine.
<BR><BR> A direct metabolite of amino acids glutamine and glutamic acid, theanine is made different by its ethyl-N alkylation of glutamine's nitrogen.  The amino acid scaffolds glutamine and its metabolite glutamic acid provide the general, alpha amino
acid core structure responsible for theanine's transport, while ethyl-N alkylation of glutamine provides both its transport and pharmacological properties.  The similarity of glutamine's and glutamic acid's structure with theanine allows theanine to be
substrate and product competitors for all physiological glutamine and glutamic acid reactions, providing their charges are similar.  Therefore, wherever glutamine or glutamic acid is a metabolite, theanine can activate, inhibit or add to target activity. This is why its effects are so far-reaching.  It is a glutamine mimetic with pharmacological activity.  Glutamine is a significant consumer of ATP for nitrogen incorporation, which may explain some of the anti-cancer and anti-HIV activity of theanine. 
If N-fixation is inhibited, cell or viral structure growth is also inhibited.
<BR><BR> The amino acids glutamine and glutamic acid have common molecular elements with theanine.  Some examples of common molecular elements are pl(isoelectric point), polarity, hydropathy index, and elements that support their role as metabolite
targets for theanine.  The overlapping molecular properties allow theanine to function as a glutamine or glutamic acid analogue.  These properties relate to the electrostatic profile of theanine under physiological conditions and its overall structural
geometry, which includes atoms common to the related core amino acids glutamine and glutamic acid.  The coincident array of atoms and the relative electrostatic structure of glutamine and glutamic acid allow them to serve as targets for theanine.  The
targets also include the enzymes, proteins, receptors or other macromolecules they effectively bind.  In the case of glutamic acid, the atoms that make up the isosteric structure up to the C5 or gamma carboxyl are in the same array as theanine.  In the
case of glutamine, the isosteric and isoelectronic atoms of glutamine are equal to theanine's where hydrogen has been replaced by ethyl (--C.sub.2H.sub.5) on the carboxamide nitrogen of glutamine.
<BR><BR> Glutathione is the liver's first-line defense against drugs and chemicals.  It is used by cancer cells against drugs and chemicals.  Cancer cells use glutathione to detoxify doxorubicin and escort the drug out of cells.  Theanine is able to
interfere with this process due to its structural similarity to glutamate.  Glutamic acid, or glutamate, is one of the components of glutathione, the drug detoxifier.  Because it looks like glutamic acid, cancer cells take up and mistakenly use the
theanine to create glutathione.  But the glutathione they create with theanine does not detoxify like natural glutathione.  Instead, this theanine-based glutathione appears to block the ability of cancer cells to detoxify.
<BR><BR> Further, in addition to enhancing doxorubicin's cancer-killing effects without harming healthy tissue, theanine also keeps doxorubicin out of healthy tissue.  This is a major added benefit, since one of the drawbacks of the use of doxorubicin is
its toxicity to the heart.  The potential of theanine as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy was proposed by researcher Yasuyuki Sadzuka, who confirmed that theanine, a major amino acid in green tea, enhances the antitumor activity of doxorubicin (DOX)
without an increase in DOX-induced side effects.  He postulated that the action of theanine is due to decreases in glutamate uptake via inhibition of the glutamate transporter and reduction of glutathione and DOX export from the cell.  Theanine enhances
the antitumor activity not only of DOX but also of cisplatin and irinotecan (CPT-11).  In essence, Sadzuka found that theanine could block the export of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) from cancer cells by blocking the glutamate and glutathione transporter
mechanisms; the elevated level of the drug within cancer cells strongly inhibits the tumor.  Sadzuka Y, et al., "The effects of theanine, as a novel biochemical modulator, on the antitumor activity of adriamycin," Cancer Letters 1996; 105(2): 203-209;

<BR><BR> Therapeutic compounds, such as aspirin, are most stable in a crystalline form, but can display poor aqueous solubilities and slow dissolution rates.  These properties impart the tendency to reduce the bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API), thereby slowing absorption.
<BR><BR> A cocrystal is a multiple-component crystal, in which two or more molecules associate (but do not bond) on the molecular level in solid crystalline form under ambient conditions.  They are attractive to the pharmaceutical industry because they
offer opportunities to modify the chemical and/or physical properties of an API without the need to make or break covalent bonds.  In pharmaceutical cocrystals, the molecular structure of the API is not changed.  This has important implications for
streamlined regulatory approval of new forms.  By their very nature, APIs, molecules that contain exterior hydrogen-bonding moieties, are predisposed to formation of cocrystals.  Pharmaceutical cocrystals will afford forms of APIs with improved physical
properties such as solubility, stability, hygroscopicity, and dissolution rate.  Physical properties are not just dependent upon molecular structure.  They are also critically dependent upon supramolecular chemistry and its influence upon crystal
structure.  The application of the concepts of supramolecular synthesis and crystal engineering to the development of pharmaceutical cocrystals offers many opportunities related to drug development and delivery.
<BR><BR> Thus, a water-soluble aspirin-theanine cocrystal composition which has enhanced stability and bioactivity as compared to previously-known, water-soluble analgesic compositions, and which delivers the salutary effects of both aspirin and
theanine, is needed.
<BR><BR> The present invention satisfies these and other medical needs and overcomes deficiencies found in the prior art.

<BR><BR> An aqueous solution is a solution in which water is the dissolving medium or solvent, and which is essentially free of colloidal solids.  Dissolved crystals form true solutions and are capable of passing through a semi-permeable membrane as in
dialysis, whereas colloids are unable to pass through a semi-permeable membrane.  The compositions according to embodiments of the present invention form a true solution when dissolved in water, are able to pass through a semi-permeable membrane, and can
be used in dialysis.  Examples of aqueous solutions that may be used in embodiments of the present invention include pure water, and the following: D5W, D10W, D50, D5 0.3% NS, D5 0.45% NS, 0.45% NS, D5 0.9% NS, 0.9% NS, 3% NaCl, D5RL, LR, NaHCO.sub.3,

<BR><BR> The effective amount of acetylsalicylic acid administered to a patient (i.e., the amount that will have a salutary effect with regards to a disease or condition being treated) will be influenced by gender, age, weight, body fluid status,
severity of the disease or condition being treated, liver enzyme function, and renal excretion of salicylate which, in turn, is dependent upon urine pH, and protein binding of salicylates, which is concentration-dependent.

<BR><BR> The Tyndall effect is observed when particles of a solid are dispersed in water but not dissolved.  Such an effect is strongly observed in dispersions of Bayer aspirin, Disprin, and Aspro Clear.  No such strong effect is observed in water, or
when cocrystal compositions according to embodiments of the present invention are dissolved in water.  Colloids are particles which range in size from 1-1000 nm, and a Tyndall effect is created when a laser beam is scattered by its passage through a
colloidal dispersion of non-dissolved particles.  For such dispersions, the illumination of a visible path through the colloidal dispersion is observable.  A true solution, such as water or a composition according to embodiments of the present invention
dissolved in water, does not contain colloidal particles, and hence does not exhibit a strong Tyndall effect characteristic of colloidal dispersions.  These findings, detailed below, as well as the preceding examples, demonstrate that compositions
according to embodiments of the present invention dissolve to form true solutions in water, and do not merely disperse to form a colloidal dispersion.
