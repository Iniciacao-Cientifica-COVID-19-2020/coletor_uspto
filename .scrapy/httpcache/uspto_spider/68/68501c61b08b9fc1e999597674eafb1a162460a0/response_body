       <p> Methods, compositions and kits are disclosed for identifying patients
     with an increased risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event
     where the patient is undergoing <B><I>aspirin</I></B> antiplatelet therapy. A
     platelet-containing sample from the patient is evaluated for platelet
     hyperactivity and platelet hyperactivity in the sample is related to the
     patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event. In some embodiments
     the evaluation for platelet hyperactivity is carried out by assessing the
     function of platelets in the sample using a high shear platelet function
     test.

<CENTER><b><i>Claims</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>What is claimed is: <BR><BR> 1.  A method for identifying a patient having an increased risk of an adverse cardiovascular event wherein the patient is undergoing aspirin antiplatelet therapy, said method
comprising: (a) evaluating a platelet-containing sample from the patient for platelet hyperactivity wherein the patient is aspirin sensitive, which is defined as a patient for whom aspirin therapy is considered effective as determined by an optical
aggregation method utilizing arachidonic acid-induced and ADP-induced platelet aggregometry and (b) relating platelet hyperactivity in the sample to the patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event.
<BR><BR> 2.  A method according to claim 1 wherein the evaluating of step (a) is carried out by assessing the function of platelets in the sample using a high shear platelet function test.
<BR><BR> 3.  A method according to claim 1 wherein platelet function is assessed by a high shear platelet function test using a platelet aggregation stimulator.
<BR><BR> 4.  A method according to claim 3 wherein the platelet aggregation stimulator is selected from the group consisting of collagen, ristocetin, arachidonic acid, serotonin, adenosine-5'-diphosphate, epinephrine, and thrombin and combinations
thereof.
<BR><BR> 5.  A method according to claim 4 wherein the platelet aggregation stimulator is collagen and adenosine-5'-diphosphate.
<BR><BR> 6.  A method according to claim 1 wherein the sample is drawn under vacuum through a capillary so that it contacts a membrane comprising an aperture and platelets in the sample are activated by means of shear force and the time to formation of a
platelet plug that blocks the aperture is measured and related to the increased risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in the patient.
<BR><BR> 7.  A method according to claim 6 wherein the membrane comprises a platelet aggregation stimulator.
<BR><BR> 8.  A method according to claim 7 wherein the platelet aggregation stimulator is selected from the group consisting of collagen, ristocetin, arachidonic acid, serotonin, adenosine-5'-diphosphate, epinephrine, and thrombin and combinations
thereof.
<BR><BR> 9.  A method according to claim 7 wherein the platelet aggregation stimulator is collagen and adenosine-5'-diphosphate.
<BR><BR> 10.  A method according to claim 1 wherein the platelet-containing sample is whole blood.
<BR><BR> 11.  A method for assessing the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in a patient undergoing antiplatelet aspirin therapy, said method comprising: (a) drawing a platelet-containing sample from the patient under vacuum through a capillary so
that it contacts a membrane comprising an aperture and platelets in the sample are activated by means of shear force, wherein the membrane comprises a platelet aggregation stimulator and wherein the patient is aspirin sensitive, which is defined as a

<BR><BR> This invention relates to methods for identifying patients with increased risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event.  The invention also relates to the determination of platelet hyperactivity in a patient undergoing aspirin
anti-platelet therapy as an indication of an increased risk of suffering a cardiovascular event.
<BR><BR> The term "cardiovascular disease" refers to a class of diseases that involve the heart and/or blood vessels (arteries and veins), i.e., any disease that affects the cardiovascular system.  Over fifty million Americans have cardiovascular
problems, and most other Western countries face high and increasing rates of cardiovascular disease.  It is the number one cause of death and disability in the United States and most European countries.
<BR><BR> The role of platelets in mammalian physiology is extraordinarily diverse, but their primary role is in promoting hemostasis.  When exposed to a damaged blood vessel, platelets will adhere to an exposed sub-endothelial matrix.  Following the
initial adhesion, various factors released at the site of injury such as thrombin, ADP and collagen activate the platelets.  Once platelets are activated, a conformational change occurs in the platelet glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa receptor allowing it to bind
fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor.  It is this binding of the multivalent fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor molecules by GPIIb/IIIa receptors on adjacent platelets that results in the recruitment of additional platelets to the site of injury
and their aggregation to form a hemostatic plug or thrombus.
<BR><BR> Questions of interest include whether to administer drugs that will block, or promote, clot formation, or whether to detect deficiencies in platelet function prior to surgical procedures.  Platelets are known to play an active role in the
development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Consequently, therapeutic strategies to inhibit platelet function are extremely important.
<BR><BR> Millions of people are taking aspirin, the oldest and most widely used platelet inhibiting agent, as therapy to reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.  These include persons that have previously suffered a
cardiovascular event as well as those with elevated cholesterol, a family history of heart disease, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  Among those with risk factors, many persons that have had a heart attack or other cardiovascular event
are prescribed some anti-platelet agent, usually aspirin.  Aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) effectively reduces the risk of secondary thrombotic events in individuals who have experienced angina, myocardial infarct, peripheral artery disease, or
cerebrovascular ischemia.  Aspirin also may reduce the risk of initial thrombotic events in healthy individuals and many healthy people without a recognized elevated risk of cardiovascular disease also take aspirin as a precaution.  For this reason, many
individuals, through physician prescriptions or self-medication, take aspirin on a regular basis for the primary or secondary prevention of thrombotic disease.
<BR><BR> However, it is known that aspirin reduces ischemic vascular events by only about 22%.  Poor responsiveness to aspirin, as measured by various laboratory tests, is associated with vascular ischemic disorders including myocardial infarction,
coronary artery disease and stroke.
<BR><BR> It would be desirable, therefore, to be able to determine the likelihood of a patient undergoing aspirin therapy to experience an adverse cardiovascular event.  It would be desirable to identify patients with increased risk of a major adverse
cardiovascular event even while undergoing aspirin therapy.  The ability to identify high-risk individuals would allow physicians to focus preventive measures on those individuals, who may gain the greatest benefit, and would provide strong incentives
for those at risk to comply with such approaches.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> One aspect of the present invention is a method for identifying a patient with an increased risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event where the patient is undergoing aspirin antiplatelet therapy.  A platelet-containing sample from the
patient is evaluated for platelet hyperactivity and platelet hyperactivity in the sample is related to the patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event.
<BR><BR> Another embodiment in accordance with the present invention is directed to a method for assessing the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in a patient undergoing antiplatelet aspirin therapy.  A platelet-containing sample from the patient is
drawn under vacuum through a capillary so that it contacts a membrane comprising an aperture and platelets in the sample are activated by means of shear force.  The membrane comprises a platelet aggregation stimulator.  The time to formation of a
platelet plug that blocks the aperture of the membrane is determined and the time to formation of a platelet plug is related to the patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event.
<BR><BR> Another embodiment in accordance with the present invention is a method for assessing the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in a patient undergoing antiplatelet aspirin therapy.  A whole blood sample from the patient is drawn under vacuum
through a capillary so that it contacts a membrane comprising an aperture and platelets in the sample are activated by means of shear force, wherein the membrane comprises a platelet aggregation stimulator.  The time to formation of a platelet plug that
blocks the aperture of the membrane is measured and is related to the patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event wherein the time to formation of a platelet plug is compared to a predetermined time.  A time to formation of a platelet plug less
than the predetermined time is indicative of an increased risk of the patient for an adverse cardiovascular event. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 is a sensitivity-specificity graph depicting platelet function test results versus the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in aspirin sensitive patients with stable cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR> As mentioned above, in one embodiment the present invention is directed to methods for identifying a patient having an increased risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event.  The patients in question are those undergoing antiplatelet
therapy with administration of aspirin.  A platelet-containing sample from the patient is evaluated for platelet hyperactivity.  The results of the evaluation are employed to assess the patient's risk of an adverse cardiovascular event.  In general,
platelet hyperactivity in the sample is an indication of an increased risk of an adverse cardiovascular event.  Typically, the evaluation is carried out under high shear conditions in the presence of a platelet aggregation stimulator.
<BR><BR> The adverse cardiovascular events include, by way of illustration and not limitation, arterial thrombotic events or vascular ischemic disorders including myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, angina (stable and unstable),
peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular ischemia.
<BR><BR> Patients undergoing aspirin therapy are those patients who are being treated with an effective amount of aspirin, i.e., an amount sufficient or effective to reduce the incidence of arterial thrombotic events and/or to prevent myocardial
infarction, cerebrovascular thrombotic disease, and vascular death in individuals with stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient cerebral ischemia, peripheral vascular disease, thrombotic stroke, and the like.  Typical doses for
aspirin therapy may be between 30 and 325 mg/day.
<BR><BR> A platelet-containing sample from a patient undergoing antiplatelet therapy is evaluated for platelet hyperactivity.  The platelet-containing sample is any sample from the patient that contains platelets that can be evaluated for hyperactivity. 
In many instances the sample is whole blood or platelet rich plasma.  The particular form of the platelet-containing sample may vary depending on the nature of the method for determining platelet hyperactivity.
<BR><BR> Platelet hyperactivity in the context of the present disclosure means that the time to platelet plug formation in a given patient's platelet-containing samples is below an established cut-off value as determined from a sensitivity-specificity
graph such as shown in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> In the example of FIG. 1, platelet hyperactivity is defined by a platelet plug formation time of less than 90 seconds.  The extent that the platelets exhibit hyperactivity is related to the risk of a patient experiencing an adverse
cardiovascular event.  Generally, platelet hyperactivity, having a platelet plug formation time less than 90 seconds, means that the patient has an increased risk of experiencing a future cardiovascular event four to seven times more likely than if the
platelet plug formation time is greater than or equal to 90 seconds.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments platelet hyperactivity is evaluated using a high shear force test method or high shear platelet function test.  In some embodiments of such a method, a platelet-containing sample from a patient is drawn under vacuum through a
capillary and platelets are activated by means of shear force.  The capillary is defined by its dimension and is generally a channel having a capillary dimension, i.e., a cross-sectional area that provides for capillary flow through the channel.  At
least one of the cross-sectional dimensions, e.g., width, height, diameter, is at least about 1 .mu.m, or at least about 10 .mu.m, and is usually no more than about 500 .mu.m, or no more than about 200 .mu.m.  Channels of capillary dimension typically
have an inside bore diameter (ID) of from about 1 to about 300 microns, or from about 10 to about 200 microns, or from about 25 to about 100 microns.
<BR><BR> The capillary is manufactured from a material that is rigid or flexible, transparent or opaque.  Particular plastics finding use for manufacturing of the capillary include, for example, flexible or rigid forms of polyethylene, polypropylene,
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), e.g., TEFLON.RTM., polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene or styrene copolymers, polyurethanes, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyureas, polyamides, polyethyleneamines, polyarylene
sulfides, polysiloxanes, polydimethylsiloxanes, polyimides, polyacetates, poly etheretherketone (PEEK), and the like, either used alone or in conjunction with another material or materials.
<BR><BR> Suitable rigid materials may include, for example, glass (which term is used to include silica), e.g., Bioglass, and rigid plastics and resins, metals such as, e.g., stainless steel, and so forth.  Rigid plastics include, for example, polymers
such as, e.g., poly (vinyl chloride), polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(4-methylbutene), polystyrene, polymethacrylate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), nylon, poly(vinyl butyrate), etc., either used by themselves or in
conjunction with other materials.  The material chosen should not be reactive with the samples or reagents applied to the capillary.
<BR><BR> The vacuum or negative pressure applied to the capillary is generally that which is effective or sufficient to subject the sample to high shear force.  The term "high shear force" for purposes of the present disclosure means about 5000 to about
6000 reciprocal seconds or higher.  Typically, the shear forces are those that are similar to shear forces of arteries and partially occluded blood vessels.  The vacuum is usually about 1 to about 10 kPa, about 2 to about 9 kPa, about 3 to about 8 kPa,
about 4 to about 7 kPa, or about 4 to about 6 kPa.
<BR><BR> As a result of being subjected to a high shear force in the capillary, the platelets become activated.  Activation of the platelets means that a conformational change occurs in the platelet glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa receptor allowing it to bind
fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor.  It is this binding of the multivalent fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor molecules by GPIIb/IIIa receptors on adjacent platelets that results in the recruitment of additional platelets to a site of injury
and their aggregation to form a hemostatic plug or thrombus.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments a member is disposed with respect to an opening of the capillary.  In many embodiments the member is absorbent to liquids so that agents capable of initiating the blood coagulation process or platelet aggregation in blood can
be incorporated therein.  The member may also have a stable structure so that a precise aperture can be placed through the member such as, for example, by being punched through the member.  The member in some embodiments may also serve as a support
matrix for a reagent such as, for example, a platelet aggregation stimulator, e.g. collagen.
<BR><BR> As mentioned above, the member may be absorbent and thus may be a porous member.  The pore size in preferred porous members is such that agents can penetrate the member and there is no interference with creating a negative pressure, e.g., in a
test device, in order to aspirate blood through an aperture in the member as discussed hereinbelow.  The pore size is also selected so that whole blood does not substantially penetrate the member but rather goes through an aperture in the membrane as
discussed below.
<BR><BR> The member may be disposed with respect to the capillary such that a surface of the member corresponding to a major dimension of the member is substantially transverse to the flow of the sample in the capillary.  The term "substantially
transverse" means that the surface of the member is within about 20 degrees from perpendicular, within about 15 degrees from perpendicular, within about 10 degrees from perpendicular, within about 5 degrees from perpendicular, within about 4 degrees from
perpendicular, within about 3 degrees from perpendicular, within about 2 degrees from perpendicular, within about one degree from perpendicular, or perpendicular to the axis corresponding to the direction of flow of the sample in the capillary.  The
location of the member with respect to the capillary depends on a number of factors such as, for example, the length of the capillary, the diameter of the aperture, the nature of the sample, and the like.  In some embodiments the member is located
adjacent to an exit of the capillary, that is, an opening of the capillary through which the sample exits the capillary.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments the member comprises a membrane.  In some embodiments, as mentioned above, the membrane comprises an aperture, through which sample exiting the capillary may flow.  The size of the aperture in the membrane is dependent on a
number of considerations.  The dimensions of the aperture are chosen such that under the conditions of the particular assay a plug will be formed and the opening closed.  The aperture should not be so small that non-assay related blockages occur.  The
aperture should not be so large such that a plug does not form properly.  For the platelet function test discussed herein, the aperture is between about 100 microns to about 200 microns, or about 140 microns to 160 microns, or about 150 microns.  The
dimension of the aperture in the member does not have a great influence on the initial flow characteristics in a device.  Generally, the only passage for the sample exiting the capillary is through the aperture in the membrane.
<BR><BR> The dimensions of the membrane are such that the diameter of the membrane is at least sufficient to adequately provide for formation of, and the presence of, an aperture as discussed above.  Furthermore, as discussed below, the membrane may
comprise a platelet aggregation stimulator incorporated therein or thereon.  Accordingly, the diameter and thickness of the membrane is dependent on the amount of the platelet aggregation stimulator employed in a particular test.  The dimensions of the
membrane should be such that the membrane can comprise a sufficient quantity of the platelet aggregation stimulator.
<BR><BR> The porous members provide a support matrix for the agent or agents that promote clotting or coagulation of blood.  In some embodiments the porous member has absorbency to liquids so that reagents can be incorporated therein, yet has a stable
structure so that a precise opening can be, for example, punched therein.  The porous member is manufactured from a material that is able to maintain the size of the aperture therein even when wet.  The material should be relatively inert to the agents
used in the test and should not cause interfering activation of platelets or of the pathways.  It should also be temperature insensitive at the temperature of the test, e.g., about 37.degree.  C. The membrane may be manufactured from, for example,
cellulose esters such as, e.g., cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, and the like, ceramics, polymers such as, e.g., nylon, polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and the like, glass such as, e.g., fiberglass, and so forth.  In some embodiments
the membrane is a mixed cellulose ester (acetate and nitrate) membrane from Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.
<BR><BR> The porous members usually have incorporated therein, agents that allow direct and complete evaluation of platelet function and coagulation factors of blood.  In many embodiments a membrane comprises a platelet aggregation stimulator, which is
an agent that promotes aggregation of the platelets.  Platelets are known to aggregate under a variety of conditions and in the presence of a number of different reagents.  Platelet aggregation is a term used to describe the binding of platelets to one
another.  The phenomenon can be induced by adding aggregation-inducing agents to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or to whole blood.  Platelet aggregation in vitro depends upon the ability of platelets to bind fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor to their
surfaces after activation by an aggregation-inducing agent such as ADP or collagen.
<BR><BR> Examples of suitable platelet aggregation stimulators that may be employed in the present methods include collagen, ristocetin, arachidonic acid and the salts thereof, serotonin, adenosine-5'-diphosphate, epinephrine, thrombin, platelet
activating factor (PAF), thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP), and the like or combinations thereof such as, for example, collagen and adenosine-5'-diphosphate, collagen and epinephrine, and the like.
<BR><BR> The platelet aggregation stimulator is bound to or within the membrane usually in a diffusive manner.  In some embodiments the platelet aggregation stimulator is bound to the membrane non-covalently such as, for example, by means of adsorption,
absorption, absorption and drying, and so forth.  In one embodiment a solution of platelet aggregation stimulator is contacted with the membrane to allow the membrane pores to absorb with the solution.  Then, the membrane is removed from contact with the
solution and dried.
<BR><BR> The amount of the platelet aggregation stimulator on the membrane is that which is effective or sufficient to promote aggregation of the platelets in the sample under the conditions of the present methods.  The amount employed depends on the
nature of the platelet aggregation stimulator, the nature of the sample and the like.  The amount of platelet aggregation stimulator is about 1 .mu.g to about 100 .mu.g, about 5 .mu.g to about 80 .mu.g, about 10 .mu.g to about 70 .mu.g, about 20 .mu.g to
about 60 .mu.g, or about 30 .mu.g to about 50 .mu.g, and the like.  In one embodiment the membrane comprises 50 .mu.g of adenosine-5'-diphosphate and about 2 .mu.g of collagen.  By "diffusively bound" is meant that the platelet aggregation stimulator is
bound to the membrane so that it will be removed from the membrane during the present method, usually, upon contact with, or exposure to, a sample being tested.  The platelet aggregation stimulator may be incorporated in the membrane as a result of an
ability to penetrate the membrane and, in some embodiments saturate the membrane, thereby forming a film on the membrane as well as being incorporated therein.
<BR><BR> The high shear force test method or high shear platelet function test is usually conducted at moderate temperatures such as for example, about 25 to about 45.degree.  C., about 30 to about 40.degree.  C., about 37 to about 38.degree.  C., and so
forth.
<BR><BR> The time it takes to form, i.e., the time to formation of, a platelet plug that blocks the aperture is measured and related to hyperactivity of the platelets and, ultimately, to the risk of a patient undergoing aspirin antiplatelet therapy to
experience an adverse cardiovascular event.  In some embodiments the aperture is considered to be blocked when blood flow through the capillary has been reduced to 10% of its initial flow.  The time period is generally measured from the point of
application of vacuum to the capillary to the point of formation of a platelet plug that blocks the aperture.  In some embodiments this time period is referred to as the closure time.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments the time to formation of a platelet plug is compared to a predetermined time, and a time to formation of the platelet plug that is less than the predetermined time is indicative of an increased risk of the patient for an
adverse cardiovascular event.  In some embodiments the predetermined time is established as follows: perform platelet function testing with blood samples from patients taking aspirin and having cardiovascular disease.  Using the results of the platelet
function testing and adverse event information collected on the same population of patients over a time period of six months, one year or longer, construct a sensitivity-specificity graph as shown in FIG. 1 using receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis. 
From the ROC curve, draw a line from the point termed "perfect" to the closest point on the curve.  This point on the curve defines the optimum cut-off value or decision point or predetermined time of the test.  In some embodiments the extent of the risk
for an adverse cardiovascular event is directly related to the extent by which the time to formation of a platelet plug is less than the predetermined time.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments the methods disclosed herein may be carried out using apparatus and reagents disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,854,076, the relevant disclosure and figures thereof being incorporated herein by reference.  In the embodiments in
the above patent, the capillary and membrane are present in a test cartridge, which comprises a housing that defines a holding chamber and a test chamber.  The housing may include a flange, a tab, and a removable top seal, which in the assembled device
is hermetically sealed to the flange and closed at the bottom with a bottom seal.  The test chamber is adapted to receive a sample cup.  The sample cup supports a reagent treated porous member having an aperture therein and a capillary hub that provides
a mechanism to operably attach the capillary to the sample cup.  The interior of the sample cup may be provided with positioning means such as vacuum chuck stop ribs for positioning.  The housing is adapted to mate with an instrument that can create a
negative pressure in the test chamber or in a part of the test chamber.  In one embodiment, this is accomplished by a rim of a sample cup, which comprises a part of the test chamber.  The instrument has a mating component, which is capable of sealably
mating with the rim of the sample cup.  The mating component may comprise a vacuum chuck provided with O-ring, which during an assay sealably meets the rim.  The vacuum chuck is moved by the instrument to contact the rim and to exert a downward pressure
on the sample cup to move a capillary towards a pierceable member, causing it to pierce the pierceable member and extend into a sample in the holding chamber.  The stop ribs in the sample cup of the vacuum chuck limit the downward movement of the vacuum
chuck.  Sample is caused to flow from the holding chamber to the test chamber by the negative pressure created by the instrument.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments the methods disclosed herein may be carried out using the PFA-100.RTM.  system (Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, Ill.), which is an instrument and test cartridge system in which the process of platelet adhesion and aggregation
following a vascular injury is simulated in vitro.  This system allows for rapid evaluation of platelet function on samples of anticoagulated whole blood.  Membranes consisting of Collagen/Epinephrine (CEPI) and Collagen/Adenosine-5'-diphosphate (CADP)
and the high shear rates generated under standardized flow conditions, result in platelet attachment, activation and aggregation, building a stable platelet plug at the aperture in the membrane.  The time required to obtain full occlusion of the aperture
is reported as the closure time (CT) in seconds.
<BR><BR> Kits can be employed for conducting any of the above methods.  In the kit the reagents can be provided in packaged combination in the same or separate containers, depending on the cross-reactivity and stability of the reagents, so that the ratio
of reagents provides for substantial optimization of a signal from the reporter molecule used in the detection system.  The diagnostic kit can comprise in packaged combination one or more test cartridges comprising a capillary and membrane as discussed
above.  The kit may also include other reagents as may be employed in the tests.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> The invention is demonstrated further by the following illustrative examples.  Temperatures are in degrees Centigrade and parts and percentages used in this disclosure are by weight unless otherwise specified.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Patient group: A total of 326 consecutive patients were studied, all of whom had stable cardiovascular disease and were taking 325 mg of aspirin/day for at least 7 days.  Of the 326 patients, 315 were available for follow-up.  The focus of this
investigation was aimed solely at those patients for whom aspirin therapy was considered effective using optical aggregation as defined in Gum, et al. [0.5 mg/mL arachidonic acid &lt;20% and 10 .mu.M ADP &lt;70%].  By these criteria, 299 patients were
included in the present study.  However, only 296 patients had sufficient quantities of whole blood available to carry out PFA-100 testing.  Complete details of this patient group were previously reported (Gum P A, Kottke-Marchant K, Poggio E D, Gurm H,
Welsh P A, Brooks L, Sapp S K, Topol E J. Profile and prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with cardiovascular disease.  Am J Cardiol.  2001; 88:230-5.  Gum P A, Kottke-Marchant K, Welsh P A, White J, Topol E J. A prospective, blinded
determination of the natural history of aspirin resistance among stable patients with cardiovascular disease.  J Am Coll Cardiol.  2003; 41:961-5).  Pertinent demographic information is provided in Table 1 (below).  The study was approved by the
institutional review board and all patients gave informed consent.  It is important to note that, although the previous database from Gum et al. was used in the studies above, the present methods and studies are not disclosed or suggested in Gum.
<BR><BR> Blood samples and platelet function testing: Whole blood was collected in 3.8% buffered sodium citrate and testing was conducted as previously described.  Briefly, high-shear platelet function testing was performed in duplicate with the PFA-100
(Dade Behring Marburg GmbH, Germany; employed as an investigational device in this patient group) using the CADP cartridge.  The mean results of duplicate measurements were used in data analysis.
<BR><BR> Statistical Analysis of Clinical Outcome: Differences in baseline characteristics between positive and negative hypersensitivity of platelets to ADP (HSPA) groups (see below) were determined by chi-squared analysis for dichotomous outcomes.  For
continuous outcomes, a Student's t-test was performed.  An average of 22 months follow-up was obtained on patients enrolled in the study.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to generate decision thresholds (clinical cut-off values)
for the platelet function tests.  The best clinical performance of the assay is determined by finding the point on the curve that is closest to a "perfect" test (see FIG. 1).  This led to the definition of HSPA as a patient having a CADP CT &lt;90
seconds (Table 1).  Relative risk (RR) values were then calculated for the composite events and the individual component events.  Poisson regression was used to adjust for the effects of concomitant risk factors and evaluate HSPA status as an independent
predictor of the composite outcome of death, MI, or CVA, as well as the individual components.  Poisson regression was chosen for this purpose as it allows for presentation of the results in terms of RR's.

<BR><BR> Results
<BR><BR> Criteria for HSPA: By ROC analysis, CADP CT significantly correlated with the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (p&lt;0.0001, FIG. 1).  The cutoff established by the ROC analysis for HSPA was a CADP
CT &lt;90 seconds.
<BR><BR> Prevalence of HSPA associated with major clinical events: HSPA patients (125/296=42.2%) had a composite endpoint rate of 19.2% (24/125) while non-HSPA patients (171/296=57.8%) only experienced events at a rate of 5.3% (9/171).
<BR><BR> Future risk of a major clinical event: HSPA patients had a RR of 3.65 (95% C.I.: 1.76-7.57) for the composite endpoint (Table 2).  The RR increased to 6.56 (95% C.I.: 1.93-22.35) for those patients who died compared to patients with CADP CT
.gtoreq.90 seconds.  The RR values in this subgroup for 10 .mu.M ADP aggregometry ranged from 1.05 to 4.95 for the composite endpoint and the individual events of death, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident, but were not statistically
significant.

<BR><BR> Validation of HSPA as an independent risk factor: Two multivariate analyses were presented for consideration in order to show that HSPA is not merely the byproduct of some spurious correlation, but is itself a risk factor for untoward events. 
For this end goal, Poisson regression was employed to estimate the relative risks relating the various outcome variables versus HSPA and other typical risk factors.  However, the utility of these models is hampered when too many predictor variables are
used.  In order to limit the number of variables entered into the model, a Poisson regression was used to determine which risk factors were associated with HSPA, and thus could generate a spurious correlation between HSPA and the outcome variables of
interest.  This analysis found that platelet count and smoking were significantly associated with HSPA at the 0.05 level of significance (Table 3).  Thus, it was only necessary to enter these variables into the statistical model to demonstrate the
ability of HSPA to predict events, even after correcting for the effect of concomitant variables in the model (Table 4).  HSPA was a significant predictor of the composite event and death.  Though all RR estimates were greater than unity, HSPA generated
statistically insignificant results with the outcomes MI and CVA.

<BR><BR> Discussion
<BR><BR> The current study focused on results not previously evaluated using ROC analysis to assess HSPA and clinical outcomes specifically in the aspirin sensitive subgroup of patients.  Thus, despite apparently therapeutic aspirin, patients experienced
significantly increased risk of subsequent major adverse events if their CADP CT was &lt;90 seconds.  This held true when all patients (aspirin sensitive and aspirin resistant) were considered together where the RR for composite events was 2.88 (95%
C.I.: 1.50-5.52) and for death was 5.32 (95% C.I.: 1.81-15.66) (data not shown).  Additionally, the multivariate analyses support HSPA as an independent predictor of mortality rather than being merely a proxy for other risk factors.
<BR><BR> The CADP CT correlated with the composite events in a manner that appears to be independent of the presence of aspirin.  This observation is consistent with the general insensitivity of the CADP cartridge for platelet inhibition induced by
aspirin and suggests that CADP CT is detecting an underlying ADP-dependent platelet hypersensitivity that is clinically significant.
<BR><BR> The negative predictive value (NPV) of CADP CT for the composite and individual events ranged from 94.7% to 99.4%, respectively (Table 5).  Not surprisingly, the positive predictive values (PPV) were low (&lt;20%), while sensitivity and
specificity ranged from 73% to 83% and 50% to 62%, respectively.  This suggests that measurement of HSPA has high exclusionary predictive value for adverse clinical events in coronary patients.

<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> Notwithstanding the clinical importance of detecting the antiplatelet response to aspirin, underlying hypersensitivity to ADP appears to exist in some patients with stable cardiovascular disease that significantly increases their risk for major
adverse clinical events.  HSPA appears to be unaffected by therapeutic aspirin and is detectable by ADP-dependent processes that can be measured by the PFA-100.RTM.  System using the CADP cartridge.  This study intentionally focused only on those
patients defined as aspirin sensitive by previously established criteria of arachidonic acid- and ADP-induced platelet aggregometry.  Follow up averaged 22 months for the adverse clinical events of death, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular
accident.  Patients with CADP CT &lt;90 seconds (125/296=42.2%) had a composite endpoint rate of 19.2% (24/125), while those with CADP CT .gtoreq.90 seconds (171/296=57.8%) had an endpoint rate of 5.3% (9/171).  Patients with CADP CT &lt;90 seconds had a
relative risk (RR) of 3.65 (95% C.I.: 1.76-7.57) for recurrent events and 6.56 (95% C.I: 1.93-22.35) for death compared to patients with CADP CT .gtoreq.90 s.
<BR><BR> Platelet function testing in accordance with the present methods, using the PFA-100.RTM.  System as an exemplary system, appears to identify a subgroup of stable cardiovascular disease patients with increased risk of major adverse events that is
associated with hypersensitivity to ADP, regardless of apparently effective aspirin therapy.
