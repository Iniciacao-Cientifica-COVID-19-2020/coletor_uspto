<BR><BR> Osteoporosis (OP) is a major health problem affecting millions of Americans as they age because of its associated increased risk of bone fractures and death.  It is associated with sex steroid deficiency and low-level chronic inflammation both
of which increase with age and are accompanied by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF).  These cytokines stimulate the formation and bone destructive activity of osteoclasts (OCs), the cells that
resorb (degrade) bone.  Bisphosphonates (BPs) are currently the most widely prescribed drugs used to treat OP (Russell et al., 2008, Osteoporos Int 19:733-59).  They inhibit the activity, but not the formation of OCs.  Although they prevent bone loss and
reduce fractures, poor patient compliance and more recent fears about side-effects have limited their use.  In addition, many individuals are unaware that they have osteoporosis.  Thus, many patients go untreated.  Osteoporosis can also complicate
inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis, in which pro-inflammatory cytokine production is also increased.
<BR><BR> RA patients can have devastating joint destruction and generalized and localized osteoporosis.  They are treated with a variety of drugs to reduce inflammation and joint destruction, including corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and ultimately TNF inhibitors, but only 50-60% of patients achieve successful control of symptoms and signs of joint inflammation, despite the success of these combination therapies (Hyrich et al., 2006,
Rheumatology 45:1558-65; Symmons and Silman, 2006, Lupus 15:122-6).  HCQ and methotrexate act as anti-inflammatory drugs and their administration to patients who move on to TNF inhibitors typically is continued.  However, the mechanism of action of HCQ
is poorly understood and it also has side-effects, including blindness in up to 0.5-1% of patients (Motten et al., 1999, Photochem Photobiol 69:282-7; Costedoat-Chalumeau et al., 2015, Clin Rev Allergy Immunol).  HCQ replaced chloroquine (CQ) decades ago
for treatment of RA in the US and Europe because HCQ has a lower toxicity profile, including less damage to the eye and other tissues.  Recently it was reported that CQ prevents bone resorption and osteoporosis in mouse models of postmenopausal
osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism (Xiu Y et al., 2014, J Clin Invest 124:297-310).  Unlike CQ, HCQ does not prevent bone resorption in mice, and there are no definitive data showing that either of these drugs has anti-resorptive effects in humans.  CQ
is still widely prescribed in many 3.sup.rd world countries because it is much cheaper than HCQ.  Furthermore, only 50-60% of RA patients respond successfully to these treatments.  Thus, there is an unmet need to improve efficacy of existing drugs and
develop new approaches to therapy.
<BR><BR> Recent attempts to target estrogen analogs (Morioka et al., 2010, Bioorg Med Chem 18:1143-8), antibiotic agents (Tanaka et al., 2010, Bioorg Med Chem Lett 20:1355-9), and prostaglandins (Arns et al., 2012, Bioorg Med Chem 20:2131-40) to bone
with BPs through carbamate linker conjugation have been successful, specifically through chemical linkages that allow subsequent release of an active agent at the bone surface.  This approach improved the efficacy of estradiol to inhibit bone resorption,
while limiting side-effects, such as endometrial hyperplasia (Morioka et al., 2010, Bioorg Med Chem 18:1143-8).  In a related effort, this BP-drug conjugation technology facilitated adequate delivery to bone and slow release of prostaglandin "warheads"
in radiolabelled PK studies to estimate concentrations of delivered drug (Arns et al., 2012, Bioorg Med Chem 20:2131-40).  Carbamate linkers are cleaved by enzymatic or by hydrolytic means in the acidic microenvironment under the osteoclast ruffled
border in bone resorption sites, thus releasing the active drug ("warhead/payload") (Arns et al., 2012, Bioorg Med Chem 20:2131-40).
<BR><BR> Bisphosphonates have been used for decades to treat osteoporosis and reduce fracture rates in the aging population (Wasnich and Miller, 2000, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 85:231-6; Cummings et al., 2002, Am J Med 112:281-9).  However, poor patient
compliance and more recent fears about side-effects with BPs, including osteonecrosis and atypical fractures, have limited their use, and thus many patients go untreated (Rasmusson and Abtahi, 2014, Int J Dent 2014:471035; Kennel and Drake, 2009, Mayo
Clin Proc 84:632-7).  More recently, Denosumab, an anti-RANKL antibody has been developed and has anti-resorptive efficacy similar to that of BPs (Scottt, 2014, Drugs Aging 31:555-76; Mandema et al., 2014, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 99:3746-55).  However,
prescription of Denosumab has lagged behind expectations and therefore has not filled this gap in therapy.  Thus, there is a need to develop new therapies to treat this disease as the aging population increases.  Patients with RA also develop systemic as
well as localized osteoporosis around affected joints, in part as a result of the effects of the increased levels of pro-inflammatory/osteoclastogenic cytokines and also because of the adverse effects of corticosteroids on the skeleton (Hoes et al.,
2015, Expert Opin Pharmacother 16:559-71; Watt et al., 2014, Joint Bone Spine 81:347-51).  Patients on long-term steroid treatment also require effective anti-resorptive therapy, but few patients receive them during the early years of their disease when
they can lose significant amounts of bone.  Most RA patients are treated with HCQ, but if it does not have anti-resorptive activity in humans, similar to findings in mice, it will not help prevent this bone loss.
<BR><BR> There is a need in the art for new compounds and methods that selectively target the delivery of compounds, such as CQ specifically to bone tissue in order to ameliorate and/or prevent the toxic side effects arising from systemic distribution
and to make dose escalation possible in order to improve therapeutic outcomes.  The present invention fulfills this need.

<BR><BR> For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there are depicted in the drawings certain embodiments of the invention.  However, the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities of the embodiments depicted in the
drawings.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary synthetic route for BTCQ 1.  Generally, an aminomethylenediphosphonate is converted into an amide, which is then treated with triphosgene to produce a chlorocarbonate.  The chlorocarbonate is then reacted with the
chloroquine moiety to produce a carbamate, which is then treated with trimethylsilyl bromide to produce BTCQ 1.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2, comprising FIGS. 2A-2B, depicts experimental data demonstrating that BTCQ 1 inhibits OC formation more effectively than CQ and conjugates with bone matrix to inhibit bone resorption.  FIG. 2A is a panel of images depicting WT mouse bone
marrow (BM) cells.  The BM cells were cultured on plastic with M-CSF for 2 days to enrich for OC precursor (OCP) cell differentiation from the plated cells.  Then M-CSF and RANKL plus the indicated doses of BTCQ 1 or CQ were added for 3 more days to
stimulate the differentiation of the OCPs into OCs.  TRAP staining was performed to evaluate OC numbers.  FIG. 2B depicts images of bone slices that were incubated for 12 hrs with the indicated doses of CQ or BTCQ 1.  The compounds were removed and the
bone slices were washed twice.  WT mouse BM cells were seeded in the wells with the bone slices and cultured with M-CSF and RANKL for 10 days to generate OCs and stimulate them to form resorption pits on the surfaces of the bone slices.  Toludine blue
staining was performed to help delineate resorption pits, the areas of which were evaluated.  4 wells/group.  *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts exemplary bisphosphonate-chloroquine conjugates of the invention with modified linker degradation potential, reflected by differences in linker length.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 depicts the structures of racemic BTCQ 1 and the S- and R-enantiomers of BTCQ 1.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 depicts the synthesis of a Non-Cleavable BTCQ (NC-BTCQ).  NC-BTCQ compounds provide a control to test whether cleavage of the BTCQ linkage is required for its key pharmacological effects.
<BR><BR> FIG. 6 depicts the minimal inhibitory effect of NC-BTCQ 5 on osteoclast formation.  WT mouse bone marrow (BM) cells were cultured on 96-well plastic plates with M-CSF for 2 days, and RANKL+the indicated doses of BTCQ 1, CQ 2, NC-BTCQ 5 or BP
carrier were added for 3 more days.  Osteoclast numbers were counted after TRAP staining.  4 wells/group.  *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 depicts experimental results demonstrating that unlike CQ and BTCQ, NC-BTCQ does not prevent RANKL-induced degradation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of RANKL-induced OC formation.  WT mouse BM cells, cultured with M-CSF as in FIG. 6,
were treated with vehicle, BTCQ, CQ or NC-BTCQ (3 .mu.M) for 8 hrs.  Cell lysates were used to test TRAF3 and actin protein levels by Western blotting.
<BR><BR> FIG. 8 depicts experimental results demonstrating that BTCQ 1 reduces PTH-induced osteoclast formation in vivo more effectively than CQ 2.  Two month-old C57Bl6 female mice were given daily injections (day 1-10) of CQ 2 or BTCQ 1.  hPTH (10
.mu.g) was injected SC over calvariae 4.times./day in the last 3 days (day 7 to 10).  The mice were euthanized on day 11 (last PTH injection was given 2 hours before death).  The tibiae were decalcified and paraffin sections were stained for TRAP
activity to evaluate OC formation.  The numbers of osteoclasts (N.Oc) on the trabecular surfaces of proximal tibiae were expressed per mm2 trabecular area (T.Ar,).  *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.  5 mice per group.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> This invention includes the unexpected identification of novel Bone-Targeted Chloroquine (BTCQ) analogs that are useful for controlled local delivery of a chloroquine (CQ) to bone.  These bone-targeted compounds include a new chemical linker
technology designed to conjugate CQ to a non-bioactive bisphosphonate (BP).  As demonstrated herein, the compounds of the present invention have been shown to be effective in inhibiting osteoclast (OC) formation.  The compounds of the present invention
are also effective in reducing inflammation in bone related sites of inflammation.  In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are effective in reducing inflammation in arthritic joints.  The compounds of the invention produce an
anti-resorptive effect when used in vivo and inhibit parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced OC formation at a much lower dose than CQ.  Moreover, compounds of the invention have reduced systemic adverse effects than CQ (non-bone-targeted) when administered in
vivo.  The compounds of the invention are useful in treating patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis, as well as patients with other bone related disorders characterized by abnormal bone metabolism, such as cancer-bone metastasis, and
osteoarthritis.  Thus, the present invention also includes compositions and methods useful for the treatment of bone related disorders.
<BR><BR> In part, the present invention provides a new chemical approach to link certain drugs to a bisphosphonate residue for a bone-targeting purpose, in which the drug is released from the conjugates on bone, allowing for a greater delivery of the
drug to the bone compartment and a greater systemic safety of the conjugate than dosing the free drug component of the conjugate.  Safety of the bisphosphonate component will generally be enhanced due to its inert bioactivity or short term circulation in
the blood and the low dose that is administered.  The present invention also provides in part a new mechanism of action of CQ analogs, an anti-resorptive effect in humans, which to date has not been studied.
<BR><BR> The chemical attachment points and other chemical variants unique to the compounds of the invention may be modified in order to adjust the payload release rate, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.  In some embodiments,
the compound is comprised of a non-cleavable linker, and the compound has a bioactivity at least the same as the inherent pharmacological activity of the parent CQ.
<BR><BR> The present invention also includes novel methods of promoting bone formation at a site in need of bone formation in a subject or reducing bone resorption in a subject in need of less bone resorption, or both.  In one embodiment, the subject has
osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid, psoriatic and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, Paget's disease, bone cancer, cancer metastatic to bone, multiple myeloma, prosthesis loosening, and bone fracture and repair.
<BR><BR> The present invention also includes novel methods of reducing inflammation at a site in need of anti-inflammatory activity in a subject.  In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of reducing inflammation in joints.  In one embodiment,
the invention provides a method of reducing inflammation in arthritic joints.  In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing inflammation in inflamed joints of patients with inflammatory arthitides.
<BR><BR> The present invention also includes a composition for controlled local delivery of a therapeutic agent to bone, comprising at least one compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated to a phosphonate moiety via a linker.  In one embodiment,
the therapeutic agent is CQ or an analogue thereof.  The present invention also includes a composition comprising at least one compound of the invention, wherein the composition optionally further comprises at least one additional therapeutic agent.  In
one embodiment, the therapeutic agent is controllably released from the compound at the site in need of bone formation.

to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.
<BR><BR> As used herein, each of the following terms has the meaning associated with it in this section.
<BR><BR> The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article.  By way of example, "an element" means one element or more than one element.
<BR><BR> "About" as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of .+-.20% or .+-.10%, more preferably .+-.5%, even more preferably .+-.1%, and still more
preferably .+-.0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.
<BR><BR> The term "abnormal," when used in the context of organisms, tissues, cells or components thereof, refers to those organisms, tissues, cells or components thereof that differ in at least one observable or detectable characteristic (e.g., age,

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> The present invention is partly based on the discovery that CQ can be targeted to the bone by linking CQ to a high bone affinity, pharmacologically-inert bisphosphonate (IBP) using a degradable chemical linker.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the invention provides novel Bone-Targeted Chloroquine (BTCQ) analogs that are useful for controlled local delivery of CQ to bone.
<BR><BR> Compounds Useful within the Invention
<BR><BR> In one aspect, the present invention includes a compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated to a phosphonate moiety via a linker, wherein the therapeutic agent is CQ or an analogue thereof.  As used herein, the term "conjugate" refers to
a compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated or attached to a phosphonate moiety via a linker.
<BR><BR> Any suitable linker may be used in the invention, as would be understood by one ordinary skill in the art.  The linkers may be comprised of any of a variety of functional groups including an amide, ester, ether, thioether, carbamate, urea, amine
or other linkage.  In some embodiments, the linker comprises a cleavable bond, e.g. a bond that is unstable and/or is cleaved upon changes in certain intracellular parameters (e.g., pH or redox potential).  In one embodiment, the linker is cleaved due to
acidic hydrolysis.  In another embodiment, the linker is cleaved enzymatically, such as by a protease.  In another embodiment, the linker is cleaved due to both acidic hydrolysis and enzymatically.  In some embodiments, the linker is non-cleavable.  For
example, it may be desirable to prevent the release of CQ from the conjugate when the conjugate itself possesses desirable bioactivity.  As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the stability of the bond between the linker and the
bisphosphonate group and between the linker and the CQ molecule influences how slowly or rapidly each respective bond is cleaved in a particular environment, thereby influencing how slowly or rapidly CQ may be released from the conjugate.  In one
embodiment, CQ is released slowly from the conjugate.  In another embodiment, CQ is released rapidly from the conjugate.  In a non-limiting example, the linker is bonded to the CQ molecule and/or the bisphosphonate via a functional group on the linker
that provides a more stable bond, and therefore reduces the rate at which CQ is released from the conjugate.  In another non-limiting example, the linker may be bonded to the CQ molecule and/or the bisphosphonate via a functional group on the linker that
provides a more labile or less stable bond, and therefore increases the rate at which CQ is released from the conjugate.  Examples of functional groups that provide a more stable bond include an amide.  Examples of functional groups that provide a more
labile bond or a less stable or unstable bond include a carbonate group or a carbamate group.  In one embodiment, the functional group is a carbamate.
<BR><BR> In other embodiments, the electronics of the linker may contribute to the rate at which the CQ molecule is released from the conjugate.  In one aspect, the reactivity of compounds of the invention is designed to be tunable to allow for the
preparation of sufficiently stable conjugates which will still release CQ efficiently once targeted to bone due to the lower pH in the bone matrix.  The high kinetic affinity of bisphosphonates for bone allows for transport to bone to be accomplished
without significant degradation of the conjugate and release of the CQ systemically.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the linker is aliphatic.  In another embodiment, the linker comprises an aromatic ring.  Non-limiting examples of aromatic rings include an aryl group or a heteroaryl group.  In one embodiment, the aryl group is a phenyl
group.  In some embodiments, the aromatic ring is substituted.  In one embodiment, the linker is a phenyl carbamate.  As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the substituents on the aromatic ring may be selected in order to modify the
electronic character of the substituted aromatic ring.  For example, electron withdrawing groups may be added to the aromatic ring in order to decrease the electron density of the ring, while electron donating groups may be added in order to increase the
electron density of the ring.  In some embodiments, altering the electronic character of the ring may be used to modulate the reactivity of the linker, thereby influencing the rate of cleavage between the linker and CQ and thus delivery of the CQ warhead
to the desired site.
<BR><BR> The compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using techniques well-known in the art of organic synthesis.  The starting materials and intermediates required for the synthesis may be obtained from commercial sources or synthesized
according to methods known to those skilled in the art.

<BR><BR> Preparation of the Compounds of the Invention
<BR><BR> Compounds of formulae (I)-(IV) may be prepared by the general schemes described herein, using the synthetic method known by those skilled in the art.  The following examples illustrate non-limiting embodiments of the invention.
<BR><BR> In a non-limiting embodiment, compounds of the invention may be synthesized by conjugating a phosphonate to the linker region, followed by joining the chloroquine moiety to the linker using any methods known in the art.
<BR><BR> ##STR00030##
<BR><BR> For example, compounds of the invention may be synthesized by conjugating an aminophosphonate to an esterified linker region in order to form an amide using any methods known in the art.  The aminophosphonate and the ester can then be conjugated
to produce an amide.
<BR><BR> ##STR00031## The free alcohol of the amide can be acylated to form a chlorocarbonate, after which the compound can be treated with base and then reacted with a chloroquine moiety to form compounds of the invention.
<BR><BR> ##STR00032##
<BR><BR> The compounds of the invention may possess one or more stereocenters, and each stereocenter may exist independently in either the R or S configuration.  In one embodiment, compounds described herein are present in optically active or racemic
forms.  It is to be understood that the compounds described herein encompass racemic, optically-active, regioisomeric and stereoisomeric forms, or combinations thereof that possess the therapeutically useful properties described herein.  In one
embodiment, the compounds of the invention include stereoisomers and mixtures of stereoisomers.  Preparation of optically active forms is achieved in any suitable manner, including by way of non-limiting example, by resolution of the racemic form with
recrystallization techniques, synthesis from optically-active starting materials, chiral synthesis, or chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase.  In one embodiment, a mixture of one or more isomer is utilized as the therapeutic compound
described herein.  In another embodiment, compounds described herein contain one or more chiral centers.  These compounds are prepared by any means, including stereoselective synthesis, enantioselective synthesis and/or separation of a mixture of
enantiomers and/or diastereomers.  Resolution of compounds and isomers thereof is achieved by any means including, by way of non-limiting example, chemical processes, enzymatic processes, fractional crystallization, distillation, and chromatography.
<BR><BR> The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides (if appropriate), crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), solvates, amorphous phases, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds having the structure of
any compound of the invention, as well as metabolites and active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity.  Solvates include water, ether (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, methyl tert-butyl ether) or alcohol (e.g., ethanol) solvates,
acetates and the like.  In one embodiment, the compounds described herein exist in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, and ethanol.  In another embodiment, the compounds described herein exist in unsolvated form.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention may exist as tautomers.  All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs.  A "prodrug" refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo.  In one embodiment, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the
biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.  In another embodiment, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the
compound.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, sites on, for example, the aromatic ring portion of compounds of the invention are susceptible to various metabolic reactions.  Incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures may reduce, minimize or
eliminate this metabolic pathway.  In one embodiment, the appropriate substituent to decrease or eliminate the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to metabolic reactions is, by way of example only, a deuterium, a halogen, or an alkyl group.
<BR><BR> Compounds described herein also include isotopically-labeled compounds wherein one or more atoms is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found
in nature.  Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds described herein include and are not limited to .sup.2H, .sup.3H, .sup.11C, .sup.13C, .sup.14C, .sup.36Cl, .sup.18F, .sup.123I, .sup.125I, .sup.13N, .sup.15N, .sup.15O, .sup.17O,
.sup.18O, .sup.32P, and .sup.35S.  In one embodiment, isotopically-labeled compounds are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies.  In another embodiment, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium affords greater metabolic
stability (for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements).  In yet another embodiment, substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as .sup.11C, .sup.18F, .sup.15O and .sup.13N is useful in Positron Emission Topography
(PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.  Isotopically-labeled compounds are prepared by any suitable method or by processes using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the compounds described herein are labeled by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.
<BR><BR> The compounds described herein, and other related compounds having different substituents are synthesized using techniques and materials described herein and as described, for example, in Fieser & Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes
1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), Larock's Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH
Publishers Inc., 1989), March, Advanced Organic Chemistry 4.sup.th Ed., (Wiley 1992); Carey & Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed., Vols.  A and B (Plenum 2000, 2001), and Green & Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd Ed., (Wiley 1999)
(all of which are incorporated by reference for such disclosure).  General methods for the preparation of compound as described herein are modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions, for the introduction of the various moieties found in
the formula as provided herein.
<BR><BR> Compounds described herein are synthesized using any suitable procedures starting from compounds that are available from commercial sources, or are prepared using procedures described herein.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, reactive functional groups, such as hydroxyl, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, are protected in order to avoid their unwanted participation in reactions.  Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive
moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed.  In another embodiment, each protective group is removable by a different means.  Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate
reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, protective groups are removed by acid, base, reducing conditions (such as, for example, hydrogenolysis), and/or oxidative conditions.  Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and
are used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile.  Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked
with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl, in the presence of amines that are blocked with acid labile groups, such as t-butyl carbamate, or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically
removable.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids are blocked with base labile groups
such as Fmoc.  Carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as
2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.
<BR><BR> Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and are subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts.  For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid is deprotected with a
palladium-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups.  Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate is attached.  As long as the residue is
attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and does not react.  Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.
<BR><BR> Typically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:
<BR><BR> ##STR00033##
<BR><BR> Other protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene & Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York,
N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure.

<BR><BR> In one aspect, the present invention includes a method of promoting bone formation at a site in need of bone formation in a subject or reducing bone resorption in a subject in need of less bone resorption, or both.  In one embodiment, the method
includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising at least one compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated to a phosphonate moiety via a linker, wherein the therapeutic agent is chloroquine (CQ) or an analogue
thereof.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the composition further comprises at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent is controllably released from the compound at the site in need thereof.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.  The formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or
hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology.  In general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with a carrier or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary or desirable,
shaping or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
<BR><BR> Although the description of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for ethical administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such
compositions are generally suitable for administration to animals of all sorts.  Modification of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well
understood, and the ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and perform such modification with merely ordinary, if any, experimentation.  Subjects to which administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is contemplated
include, but are not limited to, humans and other primates, mammals including commercially relevant mammals such as non-human primates, cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, cats, and dogs.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions that are useful in the methods of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or sold in formulations suitable for ophthalmic, oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral, topical, pulmonary, intranasal, buccal, or another route
of administration.  Other contemplated formulations include projected nanoparticles, liposomal preparations, resealed erythrocytes containing the active ingredient, and immunologically-based formulations.
<BR><BR> A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, or as a plurality of single unit doses.  As used herein, a "unit dose" is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition
comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient.  The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for
example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.
<BR><BR> The relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject
treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered.  By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (w/w) active ingredient.
<BR><BR> In addition to the active ingredient, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may further comprise one or more additional pharmaceutically active agents.  Other active agents include growth factors, hormones, anti-inflammatories, including
corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, proteins (eg.  BMPs), and the like.
<BR><BR> Controlled- or sustained-release formulations of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be made using conventional technology.
<BR><BR> For oral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees, liquids, drops, suppositories, or capsules, caplets and gelcaps.  Other formulations suitable for oral administration include, but are not limited to, a powdered or granular
formulation, an aqueous or oily suspension, an aqueous or oily solution, a paste, a gel, toothpaste, a mouthwash, a coating, an oral rinse, or an emulsion.  The compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art
and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of inert, non-toxic pharmaceutically excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.  Such excipients include, for example an inert diluent such as
lactose; granulating and disintegrating agents such as cornstarch; binding agents such as starch; and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate.
<BR><BR> Tablets may be non-coated or they may be coated using known methods to achieve delayed disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject, thereby providing sustained release and absorption of the active ingredient.  By way of example, a
material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be used to coat tablets.  Further by way of example, tablets may be coated using methods described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,256,108; 4,160,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotically controlled
release tablets.  Tablets may further comprise a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, a preservative, or some combination of these in order to provide for pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation.
<BR><BR> Hard capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a physiologically degradable composition, such as gelatin.  Such hard capsules comprise the active ingredient, and may further comprise additional ingredients including, for
example, an inert solid diluent such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or kaolin.
<BR><BR> Soft gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient may be made using a physiologically degradable composition, such as gelatin.  Such soft capsules comprise the active ingredient, which may be mixed with water or an oil medium such as peanut
oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.
<BR><BR> For oral administration, the compositions of the invention may be in the form of tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents; fillers; lubricants; disintegrates; or
wetting agents.  If desired, the tablets may be coated using suitable methods and coating materials such as OPADRY.TM.  film coating systems available from Colorcon, West Point, Pa.  (e.g., OPADRY.TM.  OY Type, OYC Type, Organic Enteric OY-P Type,
Aqueous Enteric OY-A Type, OY-PM Type and OPADRY.TM.  White, 32K18400).
<BR><BR> Liquid preparation for oral administration may be in the form of solutions, syrups or suspensions.  The liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g.,
sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agent (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxy benzoates or sorbic
acid).  Liquid formulations of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which are suitable for oral administration may be prepared, packaged, and sold either in liquid form or in the form of a dry product intended for reconstitution with water or
another suitable vehicle prior to use.
<BR><BR> A tablet comprising the active ingredient may, for example, be made by compressing or molding the active ingredient, optionally with one or more additional ingredients.  Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable device,
the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granular preparation, optionally mixed with one or more of a binder, a lubricant, an excipient, a surface active agent, and a dispersing agent.  Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a
suitable device, a mixture of the active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and at least sufficient liquid to moisten the mixture.  Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used in the manufacture of tablets include, but are not limited to,
inert diluents, granulating and disintegrating agents, binding agents, and lubricating agents.  Known dispersing agents include, but are not limited to, potato starch and sodium starch glycollate.  Known surface-active agents include, but are not limited
to, sodium lauryl sulphate.  Known diluents include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium phosphate.  Known granulating and
disintegrating agents include, but are not limited to, corn starch and alginic acid.  Known binding agents include, but are not limited to, gelatin, acacia, pre-gelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.  Known
lubricating agents include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, silica, and talc.
<BR><BR> Granulating techniques are well known in the pharmaceutical art for modifying starting powders or other particulate materials of an active ingredient.  The powders are typically mixed with a binder material into larger permanent free-flowing
agglomerates or granules referred to as a "granulation." For example, solvent-using "wet" granulation processes are generally characterized in that the powders are combined with a binder material and moistened with water or an organic solvent under
conditions resulting in the formation of a wet granulated mass from which the solvent must then be evaporated.
<BR><BR> Melt granulation generally consists in the use of materials that are solid or semi-solid at room temperature (i.e. having a relatively low softening or melting point range) to promote granulation of powdered or other materials, essentially in
the absence of added water or other liquid solvents.  The low melting solids, when heated to a temperature in the melting point range, liquefy to act as a binder or granulating medium.  The liquefied solid spreads itself over the surface of powdered
materials with which it is contacted, and on cooling, forms a solid granulated mass in which the initial materials are bound together.  The resulting melt granulation may then be provided to a tablet press or be encapsulated for preparing the oral dosage
form.  Melt granulation improves the dissolution rate and bioavailability of an active (i.e. drug) by forming a solid dispersion or solid solution.
<BR><BR> U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,169,645 discloses directly compressible wax-containing granules having improved flow properties.  The granules are obtained when waxes are admixed in the melt with certain flow improving additives, followed by cooling and
granulation of the admixture.  In certain embodiments, only the wax itself melts in the melt combination of the wax(es) and additives(s), and in other cases both the wax(es) and the additives(s) will melt.
<BR><BR> The present invention also includes a multi-layer tablet comprising a layer providing for the delayed release of one or more compounds of the invention, and a further layer providing for the immediate release of a medication for treatment of a
disease.  Using a wax/pH-sensitive polymer mix, a gastric insoluble composition may be obtained in which the active ingredient is entrapped, ensuring its delayed release.
<BR><BR> Formulations of a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water or sterile isotonic saline.  Such formulations may be
prepared, packaged, or sold in a form suitable for bolus administration or for continuous administration.  Injectable formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold in unit dosage form, such as in ampules or in multi-dose containers containing a
preservative.  Formulations for parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, suspensions, solutions, emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, pastes, and implantable sustained-release or biodegradable formulations.  Such formulations may
further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, suspending, stabilizing, or dispersing agents.  In one embodiment of a formulation for parenteral administration, the active ingredient is provided in dry (i.e. powder or
granular) form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water) prior to parenteral administration of the reconstituted composition.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, or sold in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension or solution.  This suspension or solution may be formulated according to the known art, and may comprise, in
addition to the active ingredient, additional ingredients such as the dispersing agents, wetting agents, or suspending agents described herein.  Such sterile injectable formulations may be prepared using a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or
solvent, such as water or 1,3-butane diol, for example.  Other acceptable diluents and solvents include, but are not limited to, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, and fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or di-glycerides.  Other
parentally-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form, in a liposomal preparation, or as a component of a biodegradable polymer systems.  Compositions for sustained release or
implantation may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials such as an emulsion, an ion exchange resin, a sparingly soluble polymer, or a sparingly soluble salt.
<BR><BR> A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or sold in a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity.  Such a formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient
and which have a diameter in the range from about 0.5 to about 7 nanometers, and preferably from about 1 to about 6 nanometers.  Such compositions are conveniently in the form of dry powders for administration using a device comprising a dry powder
reservoir to which a stream of propellant may be directed to disperse the powder or using a self-propelling solvent/powder-dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient dissolved or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a
sealed container.  Preferably, such powders comprise particles wherein at least 98% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 0.5 nanometers and at least 95% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 7 nanometers.  More
preferably, at least 95% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 1 nanometer and at least 90% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 6 nanometers.  Dry powder compositions preferably include a solid fine powder diluent such
as sugar and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form.
<BR><BR> Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling point of below 65.degree.  F. at atmospheric pressure.  Generally the propellant may constitute 50 to 99.9% (w/w) of the composition, and the active ingredient may
constitute 0.1 to 20% (w/w) of the composition.  The propellant may further comprise additional ingredients such as a liquid non-ionic or solid anionic surfactant or a solid diluent (preferably having a particle size of the same order as particles
comprising the active ingredient).
<BR><BR> Formulations of a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water or sterile isotonic saline.  Such formulations may be
prepared, packaged, or sold in a form suitable for bolus administration or for continuous administration.  Injectable formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold in unit dosage form, such as in ampules or in multi-dose containers containing a
preservative.  Formulations for parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, suspensions, solutions, emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, pastes, and implantable sustained-release or biodegradable formulations.  Such formulations may
further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, suspending, stabilizing, or dispersing agents.  In one embodiment of a formulation for parenteral administration, the active ingredient is provided in dry (i.e., powder or
granular) form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water) prior to parenteral administration of the reconstituted composition.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, or sold in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension or solution.  This suspension or solution may be formulated according to the known art, and may comprise, in
addition to the active ingredient, additional ingredients such as the dispersing agents, wetting agents, or suspending agents described herein.  Such sterile injectable formulations may be prepared using a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or
solvent, such as water or 1,3-butane diol, for example.  Other acceptable diluents and solvents include, but are not limited to, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, and fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or di-glycerides.  Other
parentally-administrable formulations that are useful include those that comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form, in a liposomal preparation, or as a component of a biodegradable polymer system.  Compositions for sustained release or
implantation may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials such as an emulsion, an ion exchange resin, a sparingly soluble polymer, or a sparingly soluble salt.

agents; sweetening agents; flavoring agents; coloring agents; preservatives; physiologically degradable compositions such as gelatin; aqueous vehicles and solvents; oily vehicles and solvents; suspending agents; dispersing or wetting agents; emulsifying
agents, demulcents; buffers; salts; thickening agents; fillers; emulsifying agents; antioxidants; antibiotics; antifungal agents; stabilizing agents; and pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials.  Other "additional ingredients"
which may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are known in the art and described, for example in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1985, Genaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.), which is incorporated herein by
reference.
<BR><BR> It will be appreciated that a composition of the invention may be administered to a subject either alone, or in conjunction with another therapeutic agent.
<BR><BR> The therapeutic and prophylactic methods of the invention thus encompass the use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic agent that induces or promotes bone formation to practice the methods of the invention.  The pharmaceutical
compositions useful for practicing the invention may be administered to deliver a dose of from ng/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day.  In one embodiment, the invention envisions administration of a dose which results in a concentration of the compound of the
present invention from 1 .mu.M and 10 .mu.M in a mammal.
<BR><BR> Typically, dosages which may be administered in a method of the invention to a mammal, preferably a human, range in amount from 0.5 .mu.g to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight of the mammal, while the precise dosage administered will vary
depending upon any number of factors, including but not limited to, the type of mammal and type of disease state being treated, the age of the mammal and the route of administration.  Preferably, the dosage of the compound will vary from about 1 .mu.g to
about 10 mg per kilogram of body weight of the mammal.  More preferably, the dosage will vary from about 3 .mu.g to about 1 mg per kilogram of body weight of the mammal.
<BR><BR> The composition may be administered to a mammal as frequently as several times daily, or it may be administered less frequently, such as once a day, once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, or even less frequently, such as once every
several months or even once a year or less.  The frequency of the dose will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan and will depend upon any number of factors, such as, but not limited to, the type and severity of the disease being treated, the type
and age of the mammal, etc.
<BR><BR> Controlled Release Formulations and Drug Delivery Systems
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the formulations of the present invention may be, but are not limited to, short-term, rapid-offset, as well as controlled, for example, sustained release, delayed release and pulsatile release formulations.
<BR><BR> The term sustained release refers to a drug formulation that provides for gradual release of a drug over an extended period of time, and that may, although not necessarily, result in substantially constant blood levels of a drug over an extended
time period.  The period of time may be as long as a day, a week, or a month or more and should be a release which is longer that the same amount of agent administered in bolus form.  The term delayed release is used herein in its conventional sense to
refer to a drug formulation that provides for an initial release of the drug after some delay following drug administration and that mat, although not necessarily, includes a delay of from about 10 minutes up to about 12 hours.
<BR><BR> For sustained release, the compounds may be formulated with a suitable polymer or hydrophobic material which provides sustained release properties to the compounds.  As such, the compounds for use the method of the invention may be administered
in the form of microparticles, for example, by injection or in the form of wafers or discs by implantation.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention are administered to a patient, alone or in combination with another pharmaceutical agent, using a sustained release formulation.
<BR><BR> The term pulsatile release refers to a drug formulation that provides release of the drug in such a way as to produce pulsed plasma profiles of the drug after drug administration.
<BR><BR> The term immediate release refers to a drug formulation that provides for release of the drug immediately after drug administration.
<BR><BR> As used herein, short-term refers to any period of time up to and including about 8 hours, about 7 hours, about 6 hours, about 5 hours, about 4 hours, about 3 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hour, about 40 minutes, about 20 minutes, or about 10

<BR><BR> ##STR00034##
<BR><BR> A dry 25 mL round bottom flask under Ar was charged with tetraethyl aminomethylenediphosphonate 1 (400 mg, 1.32 mmol), and succinic anhydride (159 mg, 1.58 mmol) in dry THF (2 mL).  The reaction mixture was allowed to reflux for 2.5 hr.  The
reaction was then cooled down to 0.degree.  C. followed by the addition of 1M BH.sub.3.THF (2.63 mL, 2.63 mmol) dropwise.  After addition, the reaction mixture was warmed to rt for 1.5 hr, and was then cooled back to 0.degree.  C. and quenched with
CH.sub.3OH (10 mL).  The volatiles were evaporated in vacuo.  The residue dissolved in 10 mL CH.sub.3OH and again concentrated in vacuo.  This procedure was repeated 3 additional times.  Column chromatography of the residue using a
CH.sub.3OH--CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 gradient (5:95 to 10:90) afforded 469 mg (97%) of the amide alcohol 2 as a colorless oil (R.sub.f=0.52 (CH.sub.3OH--CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2, 1:9), visualized with KMnO.sub.4) having .sup.1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl.sub.3) .delta.  6.21

After stirring at 0.degree.  C. for 2 hr, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was extracted with 1M HCl solution (5 mL).  The aqueous extract was washed with CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (3.times.5 mL).  The combined organic phases were washed with
brine, dried over Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting residue was placed under high vacuum for an additional 30 min to obtain the resulting chloroformate as light yellow oil (92 mg).
<BR><BR> The light yellow oily chloroformate (92 mg, .about.0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 0.3 mL CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 and added to a mixture of K.sub.2CO.sub.3 (138.2 mg, 1 mmol) and chloroquine (CQ) (63.8 mg, 0.2 mmol) in dry CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 (0.8 mL) at
0.degree.  C. under Ar.  After being stirred for 1.5 hr at 0.degree.  C., the reaction mixture was filtered and the solids washed with 3 mL dry CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2.  The filtrate was transferred to a dry 25 mL round bottom flask under Ar at 0.degree.  C.
followed by dropwise addition of TMS-Br (122.5 mg, 0.8 mmol).  After 20 min, the reaction was allowed to warm to rt for 24 hr.  The volatiles were evaporated in vacuo.  The residue was dissolved in CH OH (8 mL) and then concentrated in vacuo.  This
procedure was repeated 4 additional times to obtain dark brown oil.  The resulting oil was dissolved in EtOH (1 mL) followed by addition to 10 mL of Et.sub.2O resulting in formation of a brownish-white precipitate.  The solid was isolated by filtration
and dried under high vacuum overnight affording 148 mg (90-100%) of 3 (BTCQ 1) (CH.sub.3OH--H.sub.2O solvate) a white solid having .sup.1H NMR (500 MHz, D.sub.2O) .delta.  8.25 (s, 1H), 8.18 (d, J=5 Hz, 1H), 7.79 (1H), 7.59 (d, J=10 Hz, 1H), 6.80 (s,

<BR><BR>Example 2: Development of Bone-Targeted Chloroquine Using Novel Bisphosphonate Prodrug Technology to Inhibit Bone Resorption & Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis
<BR><BR> It was hypothesized that if CQ could be targeted to bone using compounds, such as bisphosphonates (BPs), which have high affinity for bone (Bagi et al., 2005, Adv Drug Deliv Rev), it could be administered at lower but still effective
concentrations and thus side-effects could be reduced or prevented
<BR><BR> Bone-Targeted Chloroquine (BTCQ) analogs have been generated by linking CQ to a non-bioactive BP using degradable amide linker chemistry (moieties) to determine if the CQ released in bone would have anti-osteoclast efficacy at least equivalent
to CQ in standard in vitro OC formation assays.  As controls, the effects of the non-bioactive BP that would be released in the bone compartment as well as a non-releasable/non-degradable amide linked conjugate that also comprises a BTCQ and resembled
the degradable conjugate were also studied (FIG. 1).  In in vitro studies the BTCQ conjugate BTCQ 1 bearing a degradable linker had anti-osteoclast activity equivalent to or better than CQ itself.  In a pivotal in vitro study, this BTCQ conjugate and CQ
were independently incubated with bone slices for 12 hours after which the bone slices were removed and placed in culture wells with fresh media along with OC precursors.  Formation and activity of osteoclasts (OCs) derived from these precursors were
significantly reduced on the bone slices pre-incubated with the conjugate, but not on those slices pre-incubated with CQs, consistent with the BT component binding to the bone slices during the 12 hour exposure and the CQ being released and taken up
subsequently by OC precursors to inhibit their differentiation into OCs (FIG. 2).  In all experiments with the inert BP or non-degradable conjugate control compound, no effects on osteoclast formation or activity were observed.
<BR><BR> Both BTCQ 1 and CQ inhibited OC formation on plastic (FIG. 2A).  Interestingly, BTCQ was more effective than CQ (at 1 .mu.M vs 3 .mu.M), suggesting that the BP moiety either enables increased uptake of the attached CQ or that it attaches to the
plastic on the bottom of the plates making the CQ more accessible to the OC precursors.  Importantly, bone slices previously incubated for 12 hours with BTCQ 1 had significantly less resorption pit formation than those incubated with CQ (FIG. 2B),
suggesting that the BTCQ 1 remained attached to the bone matrix, despite washing, and CQ did not.  It was also found that the non-degradable form of BTCQ 1 had little or no effect for OC and resorption pit formation.  Although not wishing to be bound by
any particular theory, these results suggest that the enhanced inhibitory effects of BTCQ 1 on OC formation and bone resorption are due to released CQ.
<BR><BR> Non-bioactive BPs were used to avoid confounding effects associated with direct action of active BPs on OCs and bone destruction.  A tethered 1-aminomethane-1,1-bisphosphonic acid was chosen as the targeting BP module since it was expected to
have limited anti-resorptive activity, thus permitting determination of the activity delivered by the warhead, CQ.  Next, a potentially cleavable carbamate conjugate of chloroquine (BTCQ 1) was prepared according to the route shown in FIG. 1 by linking
chloroquine (2, blue) to BP hydroxy acid 3 (red).  In vitro, BTCQ 1 was shown to release CQ in bone, along with BP hydroxy acid (4).  Secondly, for control purposes, the bisphosphonic free acid analog 4 that is released with chloroquine 2 after
metabolism in the bone compartment and a non-cleavable amide linked conjugate (5, FIG. 3) were prepared for the initial in vitro testing.  Neither of these analogs had any anti-osteoclastic activity in vitro, further confirming the necessity for
conjugate release to enable a pharmacological effect on bone cells.
<BR><BR> Sufficient quantities of the degradable BTCQ analog BTCQ 1 are generated to determine in dose-response experiments if it will inhibit bone resorption in vivo at doses lower than effective doses of CQ and also to extend the range of analogs for
in vitro testing.
<BR><BR> Preparation of Sufficient Quantities of BTCQ Prodrug and Analogs
<BR><BR> Additional BTCQ analogs are produced in order to attenuate the rate of release of CQ in bone and assist the efforts to understand how to modulate the effects of the compounds to inhibit bone resorption.  The ability of these compounds in this
series to inhibit OC formation and resorption compared to BTCQ 1 is tested using standard in vitro assays on plastic culture plates and bone slices.
<BR><BR> First a large-scale synthesis of suitably pure BTCQ 1 (FIG. 1) is generated for in vivo testing.  These are purified using standard techniques such as precipitation from an anti-solvent to &gt;98% purity prior to use in biological studies.  The
reactions are scaled up from milligram to multigram quantities and the reaction conditions are modulated on that larger scale to obtain high chemical yields in all steps.  Purification of the final conjugate is performed by successive precipitation of a
solution of BTCQ in dichoromethane by addition of the antisolvent diethyl ether, removing triethylamine hydrobromide, the principle impurity, which remains in solution.
<BR><BR> Next, this method is applied to prepare a small group of additional BP conjugates to facilitate in vitro/in vivo optimization of CQ release in this series.  Representative structures include a corresponding urea (6) and a longer chain length
analog (7, FIG. 3) that are hypothesized to offer slower release characteristics and improve the in vivo pharmacokinetics necessary with this approach.  These analogs will be prepared by routes analogous to those employed for BTCQ 1 (FIG. 1).  In
addition, the bisphosphonate control compound (5) is provided in larger amounts for in vivo comparison.  Modifications of the CQ warhead results in customized analogues with novel structures.  These analogues provide further information as to how the
release rate of chloroquine conjugate analogs on bone can be modulate.  For example, other potential attachment points and chemical variants within this structure are explored that may further adjust the warhead release rate.
<BR><BR> Determination of the Optimal Effective Dose of BTCQ 1 to Inhibit PTH-Induced Bone Resorption and Bone Marrow Fibrosis In Vivo.
<BR><BR> Well-established protocols of 4.times.  daily injection of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for 3 days are used to induce increased osteoclastic bone resorption and marrow fibrosis and administer CQ, BTCQ 1 or vehicle in dose-response experiments
before and during PTH administration.  The experiments examine whether BTCQ inhibits bone resorption and marrow fibrosis at lower doses than CQ in paraffin-embedded sections of tibial metaphyses using bone histomorphometry.
<BR><BR> The effective dose of BTCQ 1 to inhibit PTH-induced OC formation and bone marrow fibrosis is determined in vivo.  The efficacy of the BTCQ 1 as prepared as described above is examined in the in vivo hyperparathyroidism bone resorption model (Xiu
Y et al., 2014, J Clin Invest 124:297-310), which was first used to demonstrate that recombinant PTH-related peptide induced OC formation and bone resorption as efficaciously as PTH (Yates et al., 1988, J Clin Invest 81:932-8).
<BR><BR> 2-month-old female C57/BL6 mice are used.  50, 10, and 2, mg/kg of BTCQ 1 or CQ or vehicle is injected i.p.  once daily to mice for 10 days, 8 mice/group.  50 mg/kg CQ is the dose that effectively block PTH-induced marrow fibrosis (Xiu Y et al.,
2014, J Clin Invest 124:297-310).  From day-7, vehicle or PTH (10 .mu.g/injection) are injected 4.times./d for 3, as previously reported (Xiu Y et al., 2014, J Clin Invest 124:297-310).  Mice re sacrificed at day 10.  Long bones and vertebrae re fixed in
formalin, decalcified in EDTA and processed through paraffin.  Marrow fibrosis and OC parameters are evaluated in H&E and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained sections, using previously reported methods (Xiu Y et al., 2014, J Clin Invest
124:297-310; Yao et al., 2009, J Clin Invest 119:3024-34).
<BR><BR> The OC formation and bone resorption inhibitor effects of the new BTCQ compounds are evaluated in vitro.  Bone marrow (BM) cells (4.times.10.sup.4) from C57/BL6 mice are cultured in 96-well plates in .alpha.-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and
M-CSF (10 ng/mL) for 2 days to enrich for OC precursors, which then are treated with CQ or BTCQ (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 .mu.g) and RANKL (10 ng/mL) for an 2-3 additional days in dose-response and time-course studies.  M-CSF and RANKL are cytokines essential
for OC formation, which are assessed by counting tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated OCs.  BM cells are also be cultured with M-CSF for 2 d on bone slices to generate OC precursors (OCPs), and then CQ or BTCQ (0.3, 1, 3 and
10 .mu.M) and RANKL (10 ng/mL) are added for 5-9 days in dose-response and time-course studies.  Cells are fixed and stained for TRAP activity to allow counting of OCs, which then is removed and bone slices are stained with 0.5% toluidine blue to
visualize resorption pits, as described (Xiu Y et al., 2014, J Clin Invest 124:297-310; Yao et al., 2009, J Clin Invest 119:3024-34).
<BR><BR> The new BP conjugates produce an anti-resorptive effect when used in vivo because the BP moiety should take most of the attached CQ to bone with the remainder being excreted in the urine (Coxon et al., 2008, Bone 42:848-60; Hughes et al., 1995,
J Bone Miner Res 10:1478-87).  BTCQ 1 is hypothesized to inhibit PTH-induced marrow fibrosis and OC formation at a much lower dose than CQ.  These dose-response experiments then inform for the determination of the lowest effective dose.  The enhanced
anti-resorptive activity of the BTCQ 1 compared with CQ on bone slices in vitro indicate that OC precursors are able to take up the BTCQ 1 and thereafter degrade the linker carbamate to free the CQ or, less likely, degrade the linkage extracellularly and
take up the CQ.
<BR><BR> All in vitro experiments are repeated 3 times.  An unpaired t-test is used for comparisons between 2 groups.  ANOVA followed by Bonferroni/Dunnet test is used for comparisons among more than 2 groups.  Mean values and SDs re calculated for each
variable.  A value of p&lt;0.05 is designated as statistically significant.  The sample size of in vivo experiments is based on an un-paired t-test power analysis carried out using SigmaStat Statistical Software: 8 mice are needed in each group where new
bone volume is being assessed to detect significant differences from WT controls with an alpha error of 5%.  The power is 0.98, i.e. there is 98% chance of detecting a specific effect with a 95% confidence when alpha=0.05.
<BR><BR>Example 3: Bone-Targeted Chloroquine Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis and Bone Resorption More Effectively than Chloroquine
<BR><BR> Described herein is the development of a novel bone-targeted chloroquine (CQ) conjugate (BTCQ) by linking CQ to a bisphosphonate (BP) with high affinity for bone, but no anti-OC activity.  This conjugate will employ a linker that is stable in
the bloodstream, but will be cleaved in the environment of the bone compartment.  Lower, yet effective concentrations of CQ will thus be preferentially delivered to bone and directed away from other tissues to reduce adverse effects.
<BR><BR> The materials and methods employed in these experiments are now described.
<BR><BR> Chemical Synthesis of BTCQ:
<BR><BR> The chemical synthesis of BTCQ and NC-BTCQ is described in FIGS. 1 and 5, respectively.
<BR><BR> Osteoclastogenesis Assay:
<BR><BR> Bone marrow cells from C57Bl6 mice were treated with M-CSF for 2 d to generate OC precursors (OCPs), which were then treated with RANKL plus CQ or BTCQ for 2-3 days to generate OCs.  OC numbers and area were evaluated after TRAP staining.
<BR><BR> Western Blot Analysis (WB):
<BR><BR> Cultured cells were lysed with M-Per mammalian protein extraction reagent.  10-20 .mu.g protein were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, incubated with primary and secondary Abs, followed by
exposure to ECL substrate.  Signals were analyzed using a Bio-Rad imaging system.
<BR><BR> PTH-Induced Bone Resorption Model:
<BR><BR> Mice were given daily injections of CQ or BTCQ for 10 days and 10 .mu.g hPTH were injected SC over calvariae 4.times./day for 3 d (day 7 to 10).  The mice were euthanized on day 11 (last PTH injection was given 2 hr before death).  Tibiae were
decalcified and paraffin sections were stained for TRAP activity to evaluate OC formation.
<BR><BR> The results of the experiments are now described.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 2A, BTCQ inhibits OC formation more effectively than CQ.  Further, BTCQ binds to bone matrix more effectively than CQ to inhibit bone resorption (FIG. 2B).
<BR><BR> To test whether the cleavage of the BTCQ linkage is required for its key pharmacological effects, a non-cleavable amide-linked bisphosphonate conjugate of chloroquine (NC-BTCQ) was synthesized (FIG. 4) and the minimal inhibitory effect of
NC-BTCQ on OC formation was tested (FIG. 6).  Unlike CQ and BTCQ, NC-BTCQ does not prevent RANKL-induced degradation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of RANKL-induced OC formation (FIGS. 6 and 7).
<BR><BR> To further understand the mechanism of BTCQ inhibition of OC formation, the ability of BTCQ to inhibit PTH-induced OC formation was studied.  BTCQ reduces PTH-induced OC formation in vivo more effectively than CQ (FIG. 8).  Further, the effects
of chloroquine and chloroquine analogs on osteoclast formation were studied in vitro (FIGS. 18-19).
<BR><BR> These data demonstrate that BTCQ can bind to bone matrix and releases CQ to inhibit RANKL- and PTH-induced OC formation and bone resorption by preventing TRAF3 degradation at lower concentrations than CQ.  Cleavage of CQ from the bisphosphonate
is necessary for BTCQ's anti-osteoclastic activity.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, BTCQ is a novel and potentially safer analog of CQ that can be targeted to bone as an anti-resorptive and anti-inflammatory agent for the prevention of bone loss in diseases characterized by increased OC formation.  It should be
possible to give significantly lower, yet still effective concentrations of CQ with fewer adverse effects by administering it in this bone-targeted formulation.
