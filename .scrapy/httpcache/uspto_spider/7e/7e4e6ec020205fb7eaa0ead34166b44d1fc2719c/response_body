INVENTION
<BR><BR>The main reason for failure in the treatment of cancer patients is resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.  One type of drug resistance is referred to as multiple resistance to cytostatics (multidrug resistance); this multiple resistance is
characterized by a cross-resistance to functionally and structurally unrelated drugs such as e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine and actinomycin D. The gene which is responsible for multiple resistance codes for a glycoprotein, named
Pgp, which operates as an energy-dependent outflow pump for cytostatics.  Some drugs from different therapeutic and chemical classes have a certain activity in partially or completely eliminating multiple resistance.  This is described for the calcium
channel blocker verapamil [Cancer Res.  41 1967-1972, (1981)], trifluoperazine, a calmodulin antagonist [Cancer Res.  42, 4730-4733, (1982)], quinidine, an antiarrhythmic [Cancer Res.  44, 4303-4307, (1984)], the immunosuppressor cyclosporin A [Br.  J.
Cancer 54, 235-238, (1986)] and rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-N-methyl-2-(2-naphthyl)-m-dithiane-2-propan amine, a calcium channel blocker [Eur.  J. Med.  Chem. 24, 493-496, (1989)].
<BR><BR>Verapamil, trifluoperazine, quinidine and cyclosporin A, which are used as specific drugs in everyday therapy, are not suitable as drugs for the control of multiple resistance because of their main pharmacological activity. 
rac-N-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenethyl)-N-methyl-2-(2-naphthyl)-m-dithiane-2-propan amine, a relatively toxic naphthalene derivative, has a clearly lower activity vis-a-vis the novel compounds of formula I described herein and has therefore not been used in
clinical trials.  It has now been found that the compounds of formula I as well as rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m -dithiane-2-propanamine [U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,003,914], which is known as a coronary dilator, have
outstanding properties as multiple resistance-modifying drugs and can accordingly be used successfully in the therapy of malignant tumors in combination with the usual cytostatics.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention is .concerned with sulphur-containing compounds.  In particular, it is concerned with compounds (dithianes) of the general formula ##STR3## wherein R is a residue of the formula ##STR4## R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are
individually hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, aryl-lower-alkoxy, lower alkylthio, trifluoromethyl or di-lower-alkylamino or when two of these residues are adjacent substituents, these substituents can additionally be taken together to form
methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, trimethylene or tetramethylene; R.sup.4 is lower alkyl; R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and R.sup.7 are individually hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or aryl-lower-alkoxy or when two of these residues are adjacent
substituents, these substituents can additionally be taken together to form methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy; X is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and Y and Z are individually hydrogen or lower alkyl or when taken together form di-, tri-, tetra- or
pentamethylene; with the proviso that X and Z are not both hydrogen and rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m -dithiane-2-propanamine is excluded;
<BR><BR>and acid addition salts thereof.
<BR><BR>These compounds are novel and are distinguished by valuable pharmacodynamic properties.  For example, they are useful for tumor treatment in combination with cytostatic drugs due to their ability to reduce multiple drug resistance.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I, their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts, and their use as therapeutically active substances.  Manufacture of these compounds, medicaments containing these compounds and
the manufacture of such medicaments are also included.  Also objects of this invention are use of compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts in the control or prevention of illnesses or in the improvement of health,
especially for reducing and/or eliminating multiple resistance to cytostatics in the treatment of tumors or for reducing and/or eliminating chloroquine resistance in the treatment of malaria.  The use of
rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m -dithiane-2-propanamine and its pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts for reducing and/or eliminating multiple resistance to cytostatics in the treatment of tumors or for
reducing and/or eliminating chloroquine resistance in the treatment of malaria and, respectively, for the manufacture of corresponding medicaments are also objects of the present invention.
<BR><BR>The term "lower alkyl" used in the present description is straight-chain and branched saturated hydrocarbon residues with 1-4 carbon atoms, i.e. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl and tert.-butyl.  The term "lower
alkoxy" is lower alkyl ether groups in which the term "lower alkyl" has the above significance, i.e. methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec.-butoxy and tert.-butoxy.  The term "halogen" embraces the 4 halogen atoms fluorine,
chlorine, bromine and iodine.  The term "aryl" is unsubstituted and substituted phenyl, whereby halogen, lower alkyl and lower alkoxy are to be understood as substituents.  The term "leaving group" is known groups such as halogen, preferably chlorine or

<BR><BR>Those compounds of formula I in which R.sup.4 is methyl are preferred.  X is preferably methyl and the carbon atom to which this methyl is attached has the (R,S)-, (R)- or (S)-configuration, particularly the (R)- or (S)-configuration.  Further,
there are preferred those compounds of formula I in which R is a residue of formula (a) or (b), particularly a residue of formula (a) in which one of the residues R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 is hydrogen and the other two residues each are lower alkoxy,
especially methoxy, or when they are adjacent can be taken together to form methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy, or two of the residues R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are hydrogen and the third residue is halogen, especially chlorine.  Also preferred are those
compounds of formula I in which one of the residues R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and R.sup.7 is hydrogen and the other two residues each are lower alkoxy, especially methoxy, or when they are adjacent can be taken together to form methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy, or
two of the residues R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and R.sup.7 are hydrogen and the third residue is halogen, especially chlorine, lower alkyl, especially methyl, or lower alkoxy, especially methoxy.  Preferably, Y and Z both are hydrogen or can be taken together to
form di-, tri-, tetra- or pentamethylene.
<BR><BR>From the above it will be evident that there are particularly preferred those dithianes of formula I which can be represented by the following formula: ##STR5## wherein one of the residues R.sup.11, R.sup.21 and R.sup.31 is hydrogen and the other
two residues are methoxy or when they are adjacent can be taken together to form methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy or two of the residues R.sup.11, R.sup.21 and R.sup.31 are hydrogen and the third residue is chlorine, one of the residues R.sup.51, R.sup.61
and R.sup.71 is hydrogen and the other two residues are methoxy or when they are adjacent can be taken together to form methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy or two of the residues R.sup.51, R.sup.61 and R.sup.71 are hydrogen and the third residue is chlorine,
methyl or methoxy and Y' and Z' both are hydrogen or together are di-, tri-, tetra- or pentamethylene, and acid addition salts of such compounds.
<BR><BR>Also preferred are those dithianes of formula I which can be represented by the following formula: ##STR6## wherein R is a residue of the formula ##STR7## one of the residues R.sup.12, R.sup.22 and R.sup.32 is hydrogen or halogen and the other
two residues are methoxy or hydrogen; and one of the residues R.sup.52, R.sup.62 and R.sup.72 is hydrogen or halogen and the other two residues are methoxy or hydrogen, and acid addition salts of such compounds.
<BR><BR>Additionally preferred are those dithianes of formula I which can be represented by the following formula: ##STR8## wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and R.sup.7 are as described; X' is hydrogen or methyl and Y" and Z" taken
together form di-, tri-, tetra- or pentamethylene, and acid addition salts of such compounds.
<BR><BR>Specially preferred compounds of formula I are:
<BR><BR>N-[[1-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]methyl]-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-met hyl-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,
<BR><BR>rac-N-[[1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]methyl]-.beta.,N-dimethyl-2-(3,4, 5-trimethoxyphenyl)-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,

<BR><BR>(S)-(+)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[[1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)cyclobutyl]methy l]-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,
<BR><BR>(R)-(-)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[[1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)cyclobutyl]methy l]-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,
<BR><BR>(R)-(-)-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethy l-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,
<BR><BR>(S)-(+)-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethy l-m-dithiane-2-propanamine,
<BR><BR>rac-N-(4-chlorophenethyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m-dithiane-2 -propanamine and
<BR><BR>rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-2-(2-naphthyl)-m-dithiane- 2-propanamine.
<BR><BR>Also preferred are the acid addition salts of these compounds, especially hydrochlorides, methanesulphonates, amidosulphonates, ascorbates, and oxalates.
<BR><BR>The process in accordance with the invention for the manufacture of compounds of formula I comprises reacting a compound of the general formula ##STR9##
<BR><BR>wherein R has the significance given above, with a compound of the general formula ##STR10##
<BR><BR>wherein R.sup.8 is a leaving group and X, Y, Z, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.6 and R.sup.7 have the significance given above, and if desired, resolving a racemic Compound of formula I obtained into the corresponding enantiomers and/or, if desired,
converting a compound of formula I obtained into a pharmaceutically usable acid addition salt.
<BR><BR>The reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III can be carried out in a manner known per se.  Conveniently, the reaction is effected in an organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions and at a temperature
between about -80.degree.C.  and a temperature of 40.degree.  C., preferably between about -20.degree.  C. and room temperature.  Ethers such as abs. tetrahydrofuran and abs. diethyl ether and the like come into consideration as solvents.  The reaction
is effected in the presence of a Strong base such as butyllithium and the like.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula II above which are used as starting materials are known.  The compounds of formula III above are partly known and partly still novel.  Thus, those compounds in which Y and Z are different from hydrogen and/or X is lower
alkyl are novel.  These can be prepared in a manner known per se, i.e. in an analogous manner to the preparation of the known compounds.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I can be converted into acid addition salts, for example by treatment with an inorganic acid such as a hydrohalic acid, for example hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like or with an
organic acid such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, amidosulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, ascorbic acid, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, camphorsulphonic acid,
ethanedisulphonic acid, anthraquinone-1,5-disulphonic acid (Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, Vol. 66, pages 1-16) and the like.  Examples of acid addition salts include hydrochlorides, methanesulphonates, amidosulphonates, ascorbates, and
oxalates.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula i may be used in a method for treating tumors with two or more unrelated drugs, which reduces cross-resistance induced by one drug, to the other, by administering a compound of formula I in an amount effective to reduce
or eliminate such cross resistance.  Drugs such as cytostatics are particularly contemplated, for example, doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine, and actinomycin D.
<BR><BR>A method for treating malaria, in particular with chloroquine, in which resistance to chloroquine is reduced, also uses an amount of a compound of formula I effective to reduce the resistance.
<BR><BR>Of the acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I there are preferred those which are pharmaceutically usable.  If an acid addition salt of a compound of formula I is obtained in the course of the process in accordance with the invention,
then such a salt can be converted in a known manner, e.g. by treatment with alkali, into the corresponding free base and, if desired, this can be converted into another acid addition salt.  Those compounds of formula I which contain an asymmetric carbon
atom can be present in racemic form or in optically active form and not only the racemic forms but also the optically active forms are objects of the present invention.
<BR><BR>These optically active compounds can be obtained by reacting the racemate with a chiral acid, separating the thus-obtained mixture of diastereomeric salts, liberating from the thus-obtained salts the two bases and, if desired, converting these
with an acid into their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts.  Since the compounds of formula I and their acid addition salts generally crystallize only with considerable difficulty, this procedure in the scope of the present invention is not
preferred.  Rather, it is preferred to manufacture these optically active compounds by introducing the desired chiral centre at the very beginning of the synthesis, namely using ;an alkyl halide of formula IV ##STR11## which is described in the
literature [Helv.  Chim.  Acta 60, 925-944, (1977)] and which is chirally labelled in the foregoing formula with an asterisk, whereby the subsequent reaction steps for the preparation of compounds of the general formula ##STR12## wherein Y, Z, R.sup.5,
R.sup.6, R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 have the significance given above, can be carried out in a manner known per se.
<BR><BR>The modifying activity of multiple resistance to cytostatics of the compounds of formula I, of rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m -dithiane-2-propanamine and of usual reference substances was investigated
as follows:
<BR><BR>KB-8-5 cells, a human cell line with multiple resistance to cytostatics, and KB-3-1 cells, a correspondingly sensitive cell line [Cell.  Mol. Genet.  11, 117-126, (1985) and Science 232, 643-645, (1986)], were cultivated in suitable media [Cancer
Res.  94, 267-275, (1984), Exp.  Hematol.  12, 559-567, (1984), Eliason, Ramuz & Kaufmann in Int.  J. Cancer 46, 113-117, (1990)].
<BR><BR>The biological test is based on the ability of the test substance to lower the concentration of a standard cytostatic which is required to kill 50% of the cells.  The testing and the determination of cytotoxicity are based on the ability of
living cells to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to the corresponding blue formazan (colorimetric measurement) [J.  Immunol.  Methods 65, 55-63, (1985)]. The cells were incubated for 2 days in separate containers.  The
compounds selected for the biological investigation were added to the cell cultures in such a manner that the serial concentrations 10.sup.-8 M, 10.sup.-7 M, 10.sup.-6 M, 10.sup.-5 M and 10.sup.-4 M were achieved.  Vincristine in 4 dilution series
(3.multidot.10.sup.-9 M, 10.sup.-8 M, 3.multidot.10.sup.-8 M and 10.sup.-7 M for KB-8-5 cells and 30 times less for the KB-3-1 cells) was added thereto.  After incubating for 5 days the cell count was measured at 540 nm using the formazan color reaction. The evaluation was carried out by calculating a resistance modification index, RMI, which is the ratio between the IC.sub.50 value of vincristine in the absence of a test substance and the IC.sub.50 value of vincristine in the presence of a test
substance.  ##EQU1##
<BR><BR>In order to compare all activities of compounds from different classes, a RMI.sub.0.1 is defined: this is the RMI value of a substance which is obtained with the ten-fold lower concentration than the IC.sub.50 value.  (RMI.sub.0.1 .tbd.RMI at
0.1.multidot.IC.sub.50 of the substance).  The results obtained for some compounds of formula I as well as for (+) and (-)verapamil are compiled in the following Table in which n is the number of experiments.  The preliminary toxicological data
(LD.sub.50, mouse) after oral administration of the test compound are also given.

<BR><BR>The dithianes of formula I, the rac-N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-.beta.,N-dimethyl-m -dithiane-2-propanamine and their salts have outstanding properties against multiple resistant cells of malignant tumors.  These compounds
can be used in combination, together or separately, with one or more conventional anticancer drugs such as vinca alkaloids or epipodophyllotoxins (e.g. vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, etoposine, teniposide), antibiotics (e.g. adriamycin,
daunorubicin, bleomycin, mithramicin), interchelators (e.g. amonafide), anti-metobolites (e.g. fluorouracil) or alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, cisplatin).  The invention is accordingly also concerned with products containing one of these
compounds and a cytostatic as combination preparations for the simultaneous, separate, or planned stepwise use in cytostatic therapy.  Both the formation of primary tumors, and the formation of metastases are prevented or greatly restricted by the novel
combinations.  As mentioned, these compounds can be administered together or separately with the cytostatics.  However, the separate prior application of these compounds, which is effected by oral administration, is preferred, while the cytostatics are
given orally or parenterally.  The cytostatics can be dosed in a smaller amount or in a similar amount as in conventional therapy.  The dosage of these compounds depends on the age, condition and weight of the patient and on the mode of application.  As
a rule, the dosage of active ingredient is about 1 to 50 mg.kg.sup.-1 body weight in the case of oral administration and about 0.1 mg to 3 mg.kg.sup.-1 body weight in the case of parenteral administration in a bolus injection or in the case of a slow
intravenous infusion.  The indicated dosages are, however, to be understood only as examples and can be adjusted according to the severity of the indication under treatment as judged by the treating physician.
<BR><BR>The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.  The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of
tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions.  The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection
solutions.  As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically usable acid addition salt thereof are also an object of the present invention, furthermore also a process for the manufacture of such medicaments which
is characterized by bringing one or more compounds of formula I and/or a pharmaceutically usable acid addition salt thereof and, if desired, one or more therapeutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients into a galenical administration form.
<BR><BR>Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used e.g. as excipients for the manufacture of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.  Suitable excipients for soft gelatine
capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like.  Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose and the like.  Suitable excipients for injections
solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like.  Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants.  They can
also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. <BR><BR>The following Examples are intended to illustrate the present invention, but are not limiting in any manner.  All temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>(A) A solution of 18.6 g (0.0759 mol) of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-cyclohexylcarbonitrile [J.  Org. Chem. 36, 1308 (1971)] in a mixture of 300 ml of abs. methanol and 400 ml of liquid ammonia was treated with 5.0 g of Raney-cobalt and the mixture
was hydrogenated in a shaking autoclave at a temperature of 70.degree.  and a pressure of 10.sup.7 Pa.  Thereafter, the mixture was cooled to -20.degree.  and filtered, and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residual oil was
distilled at 160.degree.  and a pressure of 390 Pa, whereby there was obtained 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-cyclohexanemethanamine as a colourless oil which was used directly in the next step.
<BR><BR>(B) A solution of 7.73 g (0.031 mol) of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-cyclohexanemethanamine, 4.3 ml (0.00348 mol) of N-ethylmorpholine and 0.3 g of dimethylaminopyridine in 100 ml of abs. tetrahydrofuran was cooled to -10.degree.  and treated within
10 minutes with 4.4 ml (0.0348 mol) of isobutyl chloroformate.  The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and filtered, and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the
organic solution was washed first with 1N hydrochloric acid and then with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residual oil was treated with 100 ml of abs. tetrahydrofuran and
2.35 g (0.062 mol) of lithium aluminium hydride and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 hours, thereafter cooled and treated with a saturated sodium sulphate solution.  After filtering the mixture and evaporating the solvent there was obtained an oil
which was distilled at 153.degree.  /260 Pa, whereby there was obtained 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-1-cyclohexanemethanamine as a colourless oil which was used directly in the next step.
<BR><BR>(C) A solution of 3.40 g (0.0129 mol) of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-1-cyclohexanemethanamine in 50 ml of abs. dimethylformamide was treated with 3.57 g (0.0258 mol) of anhydrous potassium carbonate.  The mixture was stirred at 5.degree. 
and treated with 1.4 ml (0.0129 mol) of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane and subsequently stirred initially at 30.degree.  for 4 hours and thereafter at room temperature for 16 hours.  The solvent was then evaporated at room temperature under reduced pressure and
the residue was treated with water.  The mixture was extracted three times with ether and the organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The oily residue was distilled under a pressure of 300 Pa
at 195.degree., whereby there was obtained N-(3-chloropropyl)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-methylcyclohexanemethanamine as a colourless viscous oil which was used directly in the next step.

mol) of a solution of butyllithium in hexane, whereby the temperature was held at -60.degree..  Thereafter, the solution was stirred at -20.degree.  for 2 hours, then again cooled to -60.degree.  and treated dropwise with a solution of 1.70 g (0.005 mol)
of N-(3-chloropropyl)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-methylcyclohexanemethanamine in 20 ml of abs. tetrahydrofuran.  After 16 hours at -20.degree.  and 4 hours at room temperature the solution was poured on to ice-water and the mixture was washed three times
with ether.  The ethereal extracts were dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residual oil was chromatographed on silica gel 60 with toluene/ethyl acetate (8:2 ).  After evaporation of the solvent there was
obtained a colourless oil which was dissolved in a small amount of abs. dioxan and treated with an excess of hydrogen chloride in abs. dioxan, whereby N-[[1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]methyl]-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-me
