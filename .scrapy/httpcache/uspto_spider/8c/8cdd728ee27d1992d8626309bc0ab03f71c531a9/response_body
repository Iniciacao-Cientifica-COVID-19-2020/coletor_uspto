<BR><BR>This application is closely related to my co-pending patent application titled, "ALKALINE AND ASPIRIN COMBINATION COMPOUND" which is being filed concurrently herewith.  The teachings of this co-pending patent application are incorporated herein
by reference thereto.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates, in general, to aspirin compounds and, more particularly, this invention relates to a method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium
bicarbonate compound that can be more widely used in relatively large doses in the treatment of arthritis and taken in relatively small doses to substantially minimize the incidence of heart attacks without the harmful side-effects normally associated
with relatively large doses of aspirin.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Aspirin is a drug that has been around for 100 years.  Nevertheless, The National Institute of Health is currently sponsoring at least 35 studies designed to probe aspirin's therapeutic role in conditions as diverse as hearing loss and allergies. It is touted as an anti-heart attack and anti-stroke medicine and is considered the number one medication for every type of arthritis.
<BR><BR>The "humble" aspirin still remains the gold standard for pain relievers as well as the cheapest.  For example, you can pay more than 20 times the cost of aspirin for an anti-inflammatory agent, which requires a prescription, and still not
experience better pain relief.  No drug in the world outsells aspirin and yet all the drug companies are still searching for a "better" aspirin.
<BR><BR>In many cases, aspirin is the drug of choice and the mainstay of arthritis therapy.  The common dosages of aspirin (325 mg or 500 mg), however, only provide relief of the symptom of arthritis (pain).  In order to achieve effective control of
inflammation, the cause of arthritis, daily dosages of greater than 5,000 mg are needed.  At these higher dose levels the rate of success is over 70%.  However, the success rate falls off dramatically and with 2500 mg.  for example, it is less than 10%. 
Thus, the cause of failure or the lack of success with aspirin therapy is the use of inadequate dosages.
<BR><BR>At the present time there is no satisfactory aspirin product available that may be used in the relatively large dosages that are required for anti-inflammatory activity.  In addition, in many cases, pain and inflammation may not be relieved
immediately, and treatment is a cumulative effect to obtain a "therapeutic level".
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, aspirin exhibits a number of undesirable side effects.  The most commonly experienced side effects are nausea, gastric upset (heartburn) and pain.  At low analgesic dose levels these side effects will generally occur in about 2-10%
of adult users of aspirin.  With higher anti-inflammatory dosages the incidence of these undesirable side effects generally rises to about 25%.
<BR><BR>The side effects are topical, as aspirin is an insoluble drug and it's undissolved particles tend to adhere to the stomach mucosa, causing irritation, inflammation and injury.  The topical nature of these detrimental side effects has been
established by gastroscopy and autopsies.  Erosion, for example, around undissolved particles of aspirin in the stomach have been photographed.  Because aspirin is a direct irritant to the gastrointestinal mucosa it's effects are both cumulative and
persistent.
<BR><BR>Topical side effects do not occur, however, when aspirin is administered in solution form.  While all users of aspirin could benefit greatly from the advantages of it's soluble form, older patients are in particular need of such a soluble aspirin
product because arthritis is a dreaded disease of old age.  The elderly, as a group, are the largest users of aspirin and, at the same time, the most vulnerable to it's acute side effects.  The incidence of these detrimental side effects is about 25%
among geriatric patients.
<BR><BR>Owing to reduced stomach motility and increased emptying time which occur with aging, insoluble aspirin particles remain in contact with the stomach mucosa much longer in the elderly, thereby intensifying the undesirable side effects.  In
addition, there are approximately 15 million people, in the U.S., who experience some degree of difficulty in swallowing tablets and other solid medications.  Older people, once again, are effected as esophagus muscles weaken with age and make swallowing
much more difficult.
<BR><BR>As is generally well known, there are some soluble aspirin products that are available commercially in the U.S., and Europe.  Unfortunately, they all suffer from one or more shortcomings which have prevented their universal acceptance, especially
in the United States.  For example, the only soluble product which is commercially available in the United States, "Alka Seltzer", contains 567 mg of sodium per 325 mg of aspirin (1,750 mg per 1,000 mg of aspirin).
<BR><BR>In order to provide anti-inflammatory activity with Alka Seltzer it would require daily ingestion of more than 8,000 mg of sodium.  This amount of sodium makes it totally unacceptable for regular aspirin therapy.  Not only is this sodium level
extremely high, for the population in general, but it can not be tolerated by many of the elderly arthritic who are also on a restricted sodium diet.
<BR><BR>Other products available in Europe either also contain sodium, dissolve incompletely or could not win FDA approval in the U.S.  for some reason.  Despite their shortcomings, however, these products still capture a large share of the market for
aspirin products from Europe to Mexico.
<BR><BR>Numerous attempts to produce a soluble aspirin product, in the past, have included salts of lithium, sodium, calcium and magnesium.  None of these soluble aspirin salt products were proven to be totally satisfactory.  It is generally well
recognized in the art that these particular salts are not only unstable, but also produce a number of undesirable side effects.
<BR><BR>Even though potassium possesses many properties that would make it an ideal compound for this purpose, potassium aspirin has never been developed as a satisfactory commercial product.  The primary reason is that the salts formed with potassium
form bitter, unpalatable solutions.  Thus, potassium acetylsalicylate (potassium aspirin) would be an ideal aspirin replacement if it could be made palatable.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The instant invention provides a method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound.  Such method includes the steps of determining a desirable dose size
for such stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound to be mixed with the granular potassium bicarbonate compound.  Thereafter, weighing out a predetermined amount of granular aspirin, having a predetermined particle size, based on
such dose size determined.  A predetermined amount of such granular potassium bicarbonate compound is placed into a container and such potassium bicarbonate compound is then substantially uniformly distributed over a bottom surface of such container to a
predetermined depth.  Such container, containing such granular potassium bicarbonate compound therein, is thereafter placed into a heat treating apparatus.  Heat treating of such predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is
carried out at a predetermined temperature which is at least sufficient to convert an outer surface layer of this granular potassium bicarbonate compound to potassium carbonate and for a predetermined time which is at least sufficient to ensure that
essentially all of such outer surface layer of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is converted to such potassium carbonate.  Then, weighing out a predetermined amount of such granular potassium bicarbonate compound after completion of such heat
treating based on the predetermined dose size determined.  Such predetermined amount of granular aspirin is then placed into a suitable package and such predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is added to such package thereby
forming the stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with such granular potassium bicarbonate compound.

<BR><BR>The present invention provides a method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound.  The method, according to the invention, includes the steps of first
determining a desirable dose size for the stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with the granular potassium bicarbonate compound which is to be packaged.
<BR><BR>A predetermined amount of granular aspirin, having a predetermined particle size, based on the dose size determined in the previous step is weighed out.  Although the present invention is not limited thereto, the dose size will usually be between
about 325.0 mg and about 1,000.0 mg.  In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the predetermined particle size of the granular aspirin is USP -60 mesh or smaller.
<BR><BR>A predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is placed into a suitable container.  The potassium bicarbonate compound is then substantially uniformly distributed over a bottom surface of the container to a predetermined
depth.  According to the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the depth of such potassium bicarbonate will generally be between about one-quarter inch and about one and one-half inches.
<BR><BR>It is presently preferred that the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is a food grade Flow K, a registered Trademark of Church and Dwight, and the predetermined amount of such granular potassium bicarbonate compound will generally be in the
range of between about 250.0 mg and about 3,000.0 mg.  The presently preferred range being between about400.0 mg and about 1,210.0 mg.
<BR><BR>The container containing the granular potassium bicarbonate compound therein is then placed into a heat treating apparatus.  The predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is then heat treated at a predetermined
temperature which is at least sufficient to convert an outer surface layer of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound to potassium carbonate and for a predetermined time which is at least sufficient to ensure that essentially all of the outer surface
layer of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound is converted to potassium carbonate.
<BR><BR>In the invented method for manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound it has been found that the predetermined temperature will generally be in a range of
between about 60 degrees C. and about 150 degrees C. It is presently preferred that the predetermined temperature be in a range of between about 90 degrees C. and about 120 degrees C.
<BR><BR>Additionally, according to the method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound, the predetermined time is generally in a range of between about 5.0
hours and about 30.0 hours.  It is presently preferred that this time be in a range of between about 10.0 hours and about 21.0 hours.
<BR><BR>A predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound, after completion of the heat treating in the previous step, is weighed out based on the predetermined dose size that had determined previously.
<BR><BR>Next, the predetermined amount of the granular aspirin, weighed out in the first step is placed into a package and thereafter, the predetermined amount of the granular potassium bicarbonate compound that was weighed out previously is placed into
the package thereby forming the stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with the granular potassium bicarbonate compound.
<BR><BR>The method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound, according to a presently preferred alternative embodiment, includes the additional steps of
selecting a sweetening agent to be incorporated into the stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate and weighing out a predetermined amount of this sweetening agent.
<BR><BR>In the presently preferred alternative method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound this predetermined amount of the sweetening agent will generally
be in a range of between about 1,135.0 mg and about 5,000.0 mg.  In the presently preferred embodiment of the method the sweetening agent is selected from a group consisting of sucrose, fructose, saccharin, aspartame, dextrose and various mixtures
thereof.  The presently preferred sweetening agent is sucrose.
<BR><BR>The method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound, may also include the additional step of selecting a flavoring agent to be incorporated into the
stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate and weighing out a predetermined amount of the flavoring agent.
<BR><BR>In this alternative method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound the predetermined amount of the flavoring agent is generally in a range of between
about 10.0 mg and about 30.0 mg.  The flavoring compound is selected from a group consisting of fruit flavors.  Such fruit flavors being selected from the group consisting of orange, lemon, lime, cherry and various mixtures thereof.
<BR><BR>The method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound, may also include the additional step of selecting an acidic compound to be incorporated into the
stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate and weighing out a predetermined amount of the acidic compound.  The predetermined amount of such acidic compound will generally be in the range of
between about 15.0 mg and about 1,000.0 mg.  These acidic compounds are selected from the group consisting of citric acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and various mixtures thereof.  The most preferred acidic compound is citric acid.
<BR><BR>In the method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound, each of the predetermined amounts of the previously weighed granular aspirin, previously weighed
sweetening agent, previously weighed flavoring agent, and the previously weighed acidic compound are placed into a mixing vessel.  Then, intimate mixing of the predetermined amount of the granular aspirin and the predetermined amount of the sweetening
agent and the predetermined amount of the flavoring agent and the predetermined amount of the acidic compound is carried out.
<BR><BR>In this alternative method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound the predetermined amounts of the previously weighed granular aspirin, previously
weighed sweetening agent, previously weighed flavoring agent, and the previously weighed acidic compound can be added and mixed in the mixing vessel in any order.
<BR><BR>In the method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound the molar amount of granular potassium bicarbonate compound used is greater than the molar amount
required to neutralize the granular aspirin.
<BR><BR>It can be seen from the above description that the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a water soluble potassium aspirin product developed to meet the special needs of arthritics who suffer from severe arthritis, requiring
large doses of anti-inflammatory, analgesic products; aspirin intolerance, due to acute side effects of products now on the market; and the inability to swallow pills or tablets.
<BR><BR>While both a presently preferred and various alternative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail above, it should be noted that those persons who are skilled in the drug art can make other adaptations and modifications to the
method of manufacturing a stabilized, essentially sodium free, granular aspirin compound mixed with a granular potassium bicarbonate compound without departing either from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.
