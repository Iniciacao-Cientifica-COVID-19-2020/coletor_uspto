<BR><BR> 3.  A method for inhibiting platelet aggregation, comprising: administering a pharmaceutical composition to a subject requiring platelet aggregation inhibition, the pharmaceutical composition comprising: Ginkgolide B in an amount of 10 parts by
weight, and Aspirin in an amount of 200 parts by weight. <HR> <CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD
<BR><BR> The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing Ginkgolide B and method for preparation and use thereof.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, born on Mar.  6, 1899, is an antipyretic and analgesic medication with a long history.  It is used to treat cold, fever, headache, toothache, arthralgia and rheumatism.  Aspirin can also inhibit
platelet aggregation, for preventing and treating ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, cardiopulmonary infarction and cerebral thrombosis, it is also effective when used in blood vessel forming and bypass transplantation.  It is the first
anti-aggregation medication to be used for antithrombosis and has been established to treat acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina pectoris and for prevention of second-stage of myocardial infarction (MI).  The principle of the
anti-aggregation effect of aspirin is that aspirin inhibits the prostaglandin cyclooxygenase of platelets and prevents the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (TXA2 promotes aggregation of platelets).  This effect is irreversible.  Specifically, Aspirin
irreversibly acetylates the hydroxyl of the 529 serine on the active peptide chain COX-1 of cyclooxygenase (COX) and inactivates COX.  This inactivation blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and inhibits platelets (PLT)
aggregation.
<BR><BR> However, among patients who take Aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke, some people show a low aspirin response and a high incidence risk.  The researchers consider that the main reason of the low response is that these patients
have developed drug resistance against anticoagulation effect of aspirin.  Among the cardiovascular disease patients taking Aspirin, patients with Aspirin resistance are three times more likely to develop myocardial infarction, stroke and even death
compared to the others.
<BR><BR> Therefore, the poor effect of using aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation needs to be improved.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The invention aims to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition with a synergistic effect for overcoming drug resistance of platelet prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor, such as Aspirin when used for anti-platelet aggregation.
<BR><BR> The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Ginkgolide B, which contains Ginkgolide B and platelet prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor,
<BR><BR> wherein, the platelet prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor is Aspirin;
<BR><BR> wherein, Ginkgolide B in an amount of 1-20 parts by weight and Aspirin in an amount of 50-500 parts by weight.
<BR><BR> Preferably, Ginkgolide B in an amount of 5-15 parts by weight and Aspirin in an amount of 100-400 parts by weight.  More preferably, Ginkgolide B in an amount of 8-12 parts by weight and Aspirin in an amount of 150-300 by weight.  Even more
preferably: Ginkgolide B in an amount of 10 parts by weight and Aspirin in an amount of 200 parts by weight.
<BR><BR> The present invention also provides a method for preparing the pharmaceutical composition, comprising the following steps:
<BR><BR> S1: weighing out raw materials of Ginkgolide B and platelet prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor Aspirin according to the predetermined parts by weight;
<BR><BR> S2: mixing the raw materials, and adding a pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary to prepare a common pharmaceutical preparation.
<BR><BR> Wherein, the platelet prostaglandin cyclooxygenase inhibitor is Aspirin.
<BR><BR> Wherein, the pharmaceutical acceptable auxiliary is selected from the group consisting of: starch, pregelatinized starch, lactose, sucrose, talcum powder, dextrin, cyclodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium
carboxymethyl starch, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, cross-linked povidone, glucose, meglumine, magnesium stearate, dextran, glycerol, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, fiber vegetable oil, sodium
benzoate, sodium salicylate, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, gelatin, lecithin and vitamin C.
<BR><BR> Wherein, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises: tablet, capsule, soft capsule, oral liquid, granules, pills, dripping pills, powder, paste, pellets, injections, suppository, patch, drop, spray, cream, suspension, tincture, emulsion, solution

<BR><BR> 1.5.  Study of Platelet Aggregation Rate
<BR><BR> After 7 days of administration, 10.5 ml of blood was taken from the heart of each animal, wherein 1.5 ml of plasma was used for taking serum and the rest 9 ml of plasma was subjected to 3.8% sodium citrate at 1:9 for anticoagulation,
centrifuging for 10 minutes at 800 r/min, and taking the supernatant to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP).), wherein 100 .mu.l of the PRP was taken for electron microscope examination, and the rest of the PRP was used for detecting of the platelet
aggregation rate; the remaining portion was centrifuged for 15 min at a speed of 3000 r/min, and platelet-depleted plasma (PPP) was obtained.  PPP was used to adjust the number of platelet in PRP, to be at 360.times.10.sup.9/L. The platelet aggregation
rate and maximum platelet aggregation rate was studied and recorded after 1 min, 5 min of addition of 10 .mu.L of PAF.
<BR><BR> 1.6.  Scanning Electron Microscopy Study of Platelet
<BR><BR> The 100 .mu.L of PRP was placed in a silicification EP tube, and 1 .mu.L of PAF was added to induce aggregation of platelets for 15 minutes, the PRP was then placed on a copper mesh sample support laid with a Formar membrane, incubating at
37.degree.  C. for 10 min, washing with ultrapure water, fixing with 3% glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes, washing with ultrapure water.  After the sample on the copper mesh was naturally dried, a layer of 20 nm gold film was plated on the surface of the
sample, and the cell morphology was studied with an electron microscope S-3000N.  100 of platelets were observed, and calculated the ratio of each type of platelet.  The types of platelet under the electron microscope includes: (1) Circle type appears
circular or oval, with small size, compact center, large core and low and narrow transparent periphery zone.  (2) Tree like type has a single or a plurality of elongated or sheet-shaped sometimes branched foot protrudes from the dense center.  (3) Flat
type has a dense core in the center and a wide transparent peripheral zone which has a smooth periphery or small bulges.  (4) Aggregated-type is usually composed of several to dozens of platelets, with different sizes of the aggregates, wherein the
platelets are mutually connected, some of the platelets are integrally fused into a whole, and the foot processes of the peripheral part are prominent.
<BR><BR> 1.7 Determination of PF-4 and .beta.-TG Levels in Serum
<BR><BR> 1 .mu.L of PAF was added to 1.5 mL of plasma for induction of release of PF-4 and .beta.-TG.  The plasma was rested at 4.degree.  C. for 4 hours, and 200 .mu.L of serum was taken for detection.  The specific operation is carried out according to
the kit specification, and the result was read by the Absorbance Reader.
<BR><BR> 1.8 Statistical Analysis
<BR><BR> The experimental results were showed in the form of mean value.+-.standard deviation (x.+-.s).  The statistical analysis is carried out using SPSS 18.0 software, and the platelet aggregation rates, the percentage of types of platelet morphology
and the concentration of PF-4 and .beta.-TG were analyzed using two-sample t-test.  P-values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
<BR><BR> 2.  Results
<BR><BR> 2.1 Result of Platelet Aggregation Rate
<BR><BR> There was a significant difference in the maximum platelet aggregation rate of the Ginkgolide B group, the Aspirin group, the Jinnaduo group and the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group and the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group comparing with the saline group, under
the induction of PAF (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;&lt;0.05).  The aggregation inhibition rate of each group is remarkably improved; the aggregation inhibition rate of the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group is higher than the rate of Aspirin group, indicating the Ginkgolide
B and Aspirin work synergistically; The mean aggregation inhibition rate of the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin groups is also higher than that of Composition 1 group (Jinnaduo+Aspirin), indicating the synergistic effect of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin is better than
that of Jinnaduo and Aspirin.

<BR><BR> 2.2.  Result of Electron Microscope Study of Platelets
<BR><BR> Four types of platelet morphology were observed under 2000-fold scanning electron microscope: Circle type, Tree like type, Flat type and Aggregated type.  Under induction of PAF, the platelets were in a similar size and had a smooth surface in
the Ginkgolide B group, the Jinnaduo group, the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group and the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group, and the Aggregated type platelets were rarely seen.  The platelets in the saline group were strongly activated, with enhanced adhesion, and red
blood cells can be seen to adhere to the platelets; the platelets were irregular in shape with enlarged size, and the formation of spore-like pseudopodium and increased number of Aggregated type of platelets were observed.  The platelets in the Aspirin
group are various in size with pseudopodium on the surface and increased number of Aggregated type platelets.  In the view of the above result, the Ginkgolide B and Aspirin have a synergistic effect.  The Aggregated type platelets are less in the
Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group than in the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group, indicating the synergistic effect of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin is greater than the synergistic effect of Jinnaduo and Aspirin.

<BR><BR> 2.3 Result of the Level of PF-4 and .beta.-TG
<BR><BR> Compared with the saline group, the levels of PF-4 of the Ginkgolide B group, the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group and the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group decreased significantly (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05); the levels of .beta.-TG of the Ginkgolide B group, the
Jinnaduo group, the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group and the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group decreased significantly (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05), while the level of the Aspirin group didn't decrease significantly.  In view of the above result, both
<BR><BR> Ginkgolide B and Jinnaduo work with Aspirin synergistically; Since the level of PF-4 and .beta.-TG is lower in the Ginkgolide B+Aspirin group than in the Jinnaduo+Aspirin group, indicating the synergistic effect of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin is
greater than the synergistic effect of Jinnaduo and Aspirin, and the platelet release function is inhibited.

<BR><BR> The results show that combination use of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin can effectively reduce the platelet aggregation rate, decrease the number of Aggregated type platelets, down-regulate the level of PF-4 and .beta.-TG, indicating the aggregation
of platelets is inhibited, and an anti-platelet aggregation medicine with good effect can be prepared using the Ginkgolide B and Aspirin.  The combination use of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin is obviously superior to using Ginkgolide B or Aspirin alone,
indicating these two work synergistically.
<BR><BR> In conclusion, the combination use of Ginkgolide B and Aspirin results in synergistic effect, and good anti-platelet aggregation effect.  The pharmaceutical composition comprising Ginkgolide B and Aspirin effectively inhibit the aggregation of
platelets, with promising clinical application.
