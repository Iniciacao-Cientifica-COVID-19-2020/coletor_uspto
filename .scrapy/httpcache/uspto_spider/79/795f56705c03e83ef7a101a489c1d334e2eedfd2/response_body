THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention is related to a unique vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplement for the treatment of both type I and II diabetes, and for the prevention of type II diabetes in those individuals with pre-diabetes, or impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT).  Specifically, the present invention is directed towards a dietary supplement for diabetic control containing a plurality of compounds from the following group: Vanadyl sulfate, Chromium polynicotinate and picolinate, Magnesium chloride,
citrate, fumarate, malate, glutorate, and succinate complex, Natural Vitamin E (free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol), Standardized Willow Bark (aspirin), Alpha-lipoic acid, and Folic acid.
<BR><BR>Diabetes has become a leading health care issue in the United States and other industrialized countries, accounting for one seventh of the entire national health care product.  The incidence of diagnosed diabetes has increased five-fold in
America over the past 35 years, with currently 8 million diagnosed diabetic patients, another estimated 8 to 12 million undiagnosed diabetic individuals, and still an additional 23 million Americans with pre-diabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As the American populace continues its strong trend towards aging, obesity and greater minority representation, the increasing rate of diagnosed diabetes is certain to continue.
<BR><BR>The tremendous economic and physical toll diabetes extracts from society is, in large part, secondary to both the short and long-term complications of the disease.  While there have been great strides made in reducing the short term complications
of diabetes, e.g. ketoacidosis, dehydration, and non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma, little, if any, headway has been made in preventing or even minimizing the devastating chronic complications of the disease, e.g. premature atherosclerosis, retinopathy,
nephropathy, and neuropathy.  Indeed, diabetes has become the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults in the United States, and now accounts for over a third of all new cases of end-stage renal disease in this country.  It is estimated that a
diabetic patient's life is shortened by 10 to 15 years, and those years of life are distinguished by a health care tab four times that of a non-diabetic patient.
<BR><BR>Diabetes is a major cardiovascular risk factor, especially among women.  This increased risk factor in women is a fact lost by many in both the medical and lay communities.  Indeed, a man's risk of dying by heart disease doubles when he develops
diabetes, but a woman's risk increases three to five-fold the day she is found to have diabetes.  The failure to reduce this increased risk for heart disease over the last eight decades of diabetes management is a painful reminder that our current
interventions, while having the potential for more favorable impact, are woefully inadequate.
<BR><BR>Type II diabetes [(i.e. maturity onset)], which accounts for 95% of diabetes, is far more than just a state of abnormal glucose metabolism, but is rather a milieu of co-existent cardiovascular metabolic risk factors, i.e. insulin resistance,
hyperinsulinemia, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL level and elevated blood pressure: a state recently identified as Syndrome X. Much of the excessive cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes is secondary to this
array of cardiovascular risk factors, which precede the onset of diabetes by as much as a decade and may explain the presence of overt clinical cardiovascular disease in as many as 60% of newly diagnosed diabetic patients.
<BR><BR>However, at least one study revealed an excessive risk of cardiac mortality in diabetic patients even after adjusting for the co-existence of other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and cigarette smoking.  The
inventor of the present invention has popularized the term "dead zone of diabetes" to describe this phenomenon of increased cardiovascular risk even after allowing for the co-existence of other risk factors in diabetes.  This "dead zone" is secondary to
both the atherogenicity of insulin resistance, which precedes the onset of diabetes by at least 8 years, and the atherogenicity of undiagnosed and uncontrolled hyperglycemia, which is present for 9-12 years before diabetes is first diagnosed.  Treatment
of diabetes, and its related chronic symptoms and risk factors, are best treated at this early stage.
<BR><BR>SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE PRIOR ART
<BR><BR>If the medical community is to have any success in attenuating the cardiovascular ravages of diabetes, it must stress interventions that reduce insulin resistance, an integral part of type II diabetes, and aggressively control blood glucose,
through earlier diagnosis and improved management of diabetes.  That is precisely why exercise and dietary modification will always be the mainstay of diabetic management, because both will improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control.  Until recently
the only available pharmacologic (sulfonylureas and insulin) interventions in this country for diabetes, poorly controlled with exercise and diet, did not address insulin resistance and were inappropriate for use in early type II diabetes.  Not
surprisingly, their use has failed to reduce the excessive cardiovascular morbidity of diabetes, and, indeed, may even be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR>Therefore, the thrust of the medical and pharmaceutical establishment in recent years has been to introduce (e.g., metformin) to this country or develop drugs (e.g., troglitazone) which act directly to reduce insulin resistance, i.e. insulin
sensitizers or enhancers, which hopefully may impact more favorably on the cardiovascular complications of diabetes.  Unfortunately, these drugs require a prescription and their use in diabetes is markedly delayed, which will likely blunt their efficacy
in reducing cardiovascular risk.  Indeed, troglitazone was initially indicated in type II diabetes only in combination with insulin, precluding its use in early diabetes.
<BR><BR>Accordingly there is a need for a supplement to control the blood sugar by reducing insulin resistance in diabetic and IGT patients, thereby preventing the chronic complications from developing in these high risk patients.  There is also a need
to provide an effective supplement for the treatment of diabetes and its symptoms prior to the onset of full-blown diabetes.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention focuses upon a new and unique dietary supplement specifically formulated for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes (IGT).  This formulation is based upon well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind human
studies, using specific minerals and trace minerals, antioxidant vitamins and acetyl salicylic acid in diabetic subjects.  The supplement of the present invention includes the precise (both composition and dosage) bioavailable preparations that have been
shown in recent human trials to safely improve blood glucose control, insulin sensitivity, lipid abnormalities, blood pressure, and reduce the risk of heart disease in people with diabetes.
<BR><BR>Specifically, the present invention provides a daily nutritional supplement for improving glucose metabolism and insulin action comprising an effective amount of a source of chromium, an effective amount of a source of vanadium, an effective
amount of a source of magnesium, vitamin E and aspirin, and an effective amount of folic acid and alpha-lipoic acid.
<BR><BR>A preferred supplement includes an effective amount of chromium polynicotinate and chromium picolinate as the chromium source, an effective amount of vanadyl sulfate as the vanadium source, an effective amount of magnesium chloride, citrate,
fumarate, malate, glutorate and succinate complex as the magnesium source, an effective amount of free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol as the natural Vitamin E source, an effective amount of standardized willow bark as the source of aspirin, an effective
amount of folic acid and alpha-lipoic acid, as well as sufficient amounts of vitamin and mineral supplements.
<BR><BR>The preferred daily does of these ingredients include between about 200 mcg and about 1500 mcg chromium picolinate and/or chromium polynicotinate, between about 10 mg and about 100 mg vanadyl sulfate, and between about 300 mg and about 400 mg
magnesium chloride, citrate, fumarate, malate, glutorate and succinate complex, between about 400 I.U.  and about 800 I.U.  free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol, between about 160 mg and about 320 mg standardized willow bark, between about 400 mcg and
about 600 mcg folic acid, and between about 0 mg and about 600 mg alpha-lipoic acid.  It is recommended that the supplement be taken for a period for at least about 30 days.  The most preferred daily nutritional supplement contains about 1000 mcg
chromium polynicotinate and/or picolinate, about 100 mg vanadyl sulfate, about 384 mg magnesium chloride, citrate, fumarate, malate, glutorate and succinate complex, about 400 I.U.  free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol, about 160 mg standardized willow
bark, and about 400 mcg folic acid.
<BR><BR>The present invention also provides a method for enhancing the natural control of blood glucose levels in a person by daily administration of the nutritional supplement.  The daily doses of the anchor or key components listed above, in
combination with vitamin and mineral supplements, can be used in patients to prevent the development of full blown diabetes or, where the person has diabetes, to reduce the amount of insulin required to control blood glucose levels. <BR><BR>DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<BR><BR>The present invention provides a dietary supplement that enhances glucose metabolism, while treating many of the secondary or risk factors that often accompany diabetes or IGT.  While the supplement may be used by individuals with no apparent
symptoms of diabetes, the supplement is ideal for use by individuals with IGT and diabetes to prevent, reduce or eliminate the necessity of using insulin or other anti-diabetic medications.  However, the supplement contains ingredients which can also
work together with insulin to enhance the effect of insulin on the regulation of glucose concentration in the blood by improving metabolism of glucose in the insulin sensitive cells of the body.
<BR><BR>Nutritional supplements according to the present invention are not intended to supplant other forms of diabetes and IGT treatment, such as the appropriate diet and exercise, nor does necessarily it eliminate the need for insulin.  Rather, the
supplements of the present invention improve glucose metabolism by enhancing the effects of natural or administered levels of insulin and an appropriate diet and exercise program.
<BR><BR>Through the formulation of the present invention, it has been discovered that a dietary supplement containing effective amounts of metabolically available forms of vanadium, chromium, magnesium, and natural vitamin E in combination with naturally
available sources of aspirin, alpha lipoic acid, and folic acid will improve the metabolism of glucose and arrest or treat many of the cardiovascular complications or risk factors associated with diabetes or prediabetes.  These components perform
different functions which, when administered in appropriate dosages and forms, enhance the metabolism of glucose in substantially the same way as insulin itself, while at the same time prevent or reduce the likelihood of a cardiovascular event due to
complications associated with diabetes.  The importance of each of these key or "anchor" components is set forth below:
<BR><BR>Chromium Polynicotinate and Picolinate (Preferred Range 200.00-1,500.00 mcg.; most preferred embodiment 1000 mcg)
<BR><BR>There has been much recent hype regarding the benefits of chromium, another trace mineral found in human tissues.  Many of the claims surrounding the use of chromium as a supplement, such as weight loss and building muscle mass, are
scientifically unfounded, especially in its use for non diabetic individuals.  Indeed, chromium supplementation, even in diabetes, is unsettled with the American Diabetes Association's Position Statement declaring, "The only known circumstance in which
chromium replacement has any beneficial effect on glycemic control is for people who are chromium deficient as a result of long-term chromium-deficient parenteral nutrition."
<BR><BR>What is certain, however, is that chromium does play a role in both the metabolism of glucose and the action of insulin in the human body.  While there is agreement on the need for chromium supplementation in those individuals who are obviously
chromium deficient, the actual prevalence of chromium deficiency in people with diabetes has never been, nor could it be, established.  Nonetheless, chromium deficiency is common in diabetic patients, who have lower plasma chromium concentrations than
nondiabetic controls.  It is estimated that up to 90% of Americans fail to consume the minimal daily requirement of 50 micrograms of chromium, and both glucosuria and diets high in refined sugar are known to promote loss of chromium in the urine.  In
addition, chromium deficiency has been linked to both glucose and lipid abnormalities, and angiographicly proven coronary atherosclerosis.
<BR><BR>After several studies using chromium reported a beneficial effect on lipids, chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 2 months was given to a group of moderately obese type II diabetic patients in a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded,
randomized, crossover trial.  While fasting blood glucose and HbAlc levels remained unchanged, there was a significant lowering (17.4%) of triglycerides.
<BR><BR>There is a strong dose-response curve to the biologic effect of chromium polynicotinate and chromium picolinate, the most bioavailable preparations of chromium.  This is powerfully illustrated by a recent study of 180 type II diabetic subjects
randomly divided into three treatment groups: 1) placebo, 2) chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily, and 3) chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily.  While both groups receiving chromium had significant decreases in both fasting and post-pranial insulin levels at
2 and 4 months, and significant drop in the 4 month HbAlc level, only the 1000 mcg group had significant reductions in the 2 month HbAlc level, the 2 and 4 month fasting and post-prandial glucose levels, and the 4 month cholesterol level.  The beneficial
effects of chromium were clearly dose related, with the 1000 mcg dose resulting in greater improvement in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and cholesterol levels.
<BR><BR>Human studies using chromium polynicotinate and picolinate have been characterized by the absence of side effects, even at the higher doses of chromium.  Indeed, chromium supplementation in gestational diabetic women was well tolerated and
without any apparent untoward effects with doses of 200-500 mcg daily of chromium.
<BR><BR>Because of the dose-response curves of chromium polynicotinate and chromium picolinate, as well as their superior bioavailability and safety, the present invention will preferably contain 200-1500 mcg.; while the most preferred dosage is 1000
mcg.
<BR><BR>Vanadyl Sulfate (preferred dosage range 10.00-100.00 mg.; most preferred embodiment is 100.00 mg)
<BR><BR>Vanadium, a trace mineral present in human tissue, has a well documented insulin enhancing effect in laboratory animals.  After extensive studies using vanadate in diabetic rats, vanadyl sulfate 100 mg daily was found to significantly improve
both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in patients with type II diabetes.  Vanadyl sulfate was the preparation of vanadium chosen because it was not associated with any apparent toxicity during treatment periods of up to one year.
<BR><BR>In a recently published study of moderately obese, insulin resistant type II diabetic patients, treatment with oral vanadyl sulfate 100 mg daily for three weeks resulted in a significant drop in fasting blood glucose levels and a highly
significant reduction in HbAlc levels.  In addition, there was a significant lowering of cholesterol and a decline, though not statistically significant, in serum triglycerides.  Using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, it was shown that vanadyl
sulfate dramatically enhanced insulin mediated glucose disposal with an 82% increase in glucose infusion rate.  There was also significant reduction in hepatic glucose production, likely secondary to a potentiation of insulin's inhibitory effect on
lipolysis by vanadyl sulfate.  As in the previous studies, vanadyl sulfate was well tolerated.
<BR><BR>Vanadium's beneficial effect on glucose metabolism appears to be strongly dose dependent.  While the use of vanadium is not absolutely necessary to practice the present invention, the preferred dosage range is 10-100 mg.; the most preferred
dosage is 100 mg.
<BR><BR>Magnesium Chloride, Citrate, Fumarate, Malate, Glutorate and Succinate Complex (preferred range 300-400 mg; most preferred embodiment 384 mg).
<BR><BR>Magnesium, rather, magnesium deficiency, has long been known to be associated with diabetes, both type I and type II.  Unlike some of the uncertainties regarding the incidence of chromium deficiency in diabetes, much more is known about the
epidemiology and diagnosis of magnesium deficiency in diabetes, though discord regarding the actual prevalence of magnesium deficiency abounds.  Indeed, magnesium deficiency may be the most underappreciated and underdiagnosed electrolyte abnormality in
medicine.
<BR><BR>Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation (positively charged element) in the body, predominately in muscle (skeletal and cardiac) and bone.  It is a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions and is involved in numerous
biochemical functions.
<BR><BR>One of these functions is maintaining the activity of the sodium potassium adenine triphosphate (Na-K-ATPase) pump, and deficiency of magnesium, therefore, results in depletion of intracellular potassium (the most abundant intracellular cation)
and sodium accumulation.  In cardiac muscle, this electrolyte abnormality can cause electrocardiographic changes and cardiac irritability, leading to myocardial infarction and potentially lethal arrhythmias.  In addition, magnesium deficiency interferes
with the activity of pumps necessary for calcium-activated potassium channels, resulting in increased free intracellular calcium levels.  This has been linked to the Reaven-Modan syndrome and underlies the well-known association of magnesium deficiency
to essential hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure and ischemic heart disease.  Also, magnesium deficiency has been associated with an increase in platelet reactivity, a condition known to exist in
patients with diabetes, and may help explain the accelerated atherosclerosis and increased rate of acute thrombotic events that so tragically define diabetes.  Finally, hypomagnesemia has been implicated in the retinopathic microvascular complication of
diabetes, with lower levels of magnesium predicting a greater risk of severe diabetic retinopathy.
<BR><BR>While it is universally accepted that magnesium deficiency is common in both type I and type II diabetes, it is unclear as to the precise incidence of this condition in diabetes.  The diabetic patient is certainly at risk for developing magnesium
depletion via inadequate dietary intake and gastrointestinal and renal losses, especially with poorly controlled blood glucose and resultant glucosuria.  However, the diagnosing magnesium deficiency in the clinical setting remains extremely difficult
because serum magnesium measures only 0.3% of the total body magnesium, and, therefore, is, at best, a highly insensitive, though very specific, assessment of magnesium depletion in the body.  Even with this exceedingly insensitive measure for magnesium
deficiency, patients with diabetes have a 25% to 38% prevalence of hypomagnesemia.  Using much more sensitive research-oriented tests (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnesium-selective dyes and electrodes) for evaluating the true
intracellular magnesium status, it was found that 90% of type II diabetic patients have low levels of free intracellular red blood cell magnesium.
<BR><BR>Still, the American Diabetes Association's position on screening, diagnosing and intervening for magnesium deficiency in patients with diabetes remains skeptical, as in the case of chromium deficiency.  The inventor of the present invention
believes this to be the case because the only currently available means for assessing magnesium depletion in the clinical setting (serum magnesium) is highly insensitive.
<BR><BR>Yet, it has now been shown that magnesium supplementation reduces, platelet reactivity in type II diabetic patients, reduces the incidence of congestive heart failure and death in patients with acute myocardial infarction, is associated with
reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and improves insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism and lipid abnormalities in diabetic patients.  Magnesium, as used in the present invention, is thus expected to improve glucose metabolism and to arrest
or reduce any diabetes associated secondary risk factors.
<BR><BR>Many preparations of magnesium are available but they differ greatly in potency, bioavailability (absorption), tolerability, and cost.  Magnesium salts, such as the oxide or the carbonate, while inexpensive, are insoluble, poorly absorbed and
associated with GI side effects, especially diarrhea.  The preferred oral preparation of magnesium is the magnesium chloride, citrate, fumarate, malate, glutorate and succinate complex because of its solubility, bioavailability, potency, tolerability,
safety, and predictability in repleting intracellular and serum levels of magnesium.  Therefore, the preferred range of magnesium complex in the present invention is 300-400 mg.; while the most preferred dosage of magnesium complex is believed to be 384
mg.
<BR><BR>Vitamin E Natural (free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol)(preferred range 400.00-800.00 I.U.; most preferred dosage 400 I.U.)
<BR><BR>Vitamin E is the most widely studied of the antioxidant vitamins.  The interest in vitamin E as an antioxidant is based on the many demonstrations in humans that giving vitamin E as a supplement decreases the oxidation of low density lipoprotein
(LDL) ex vivo, an event critical in the atherogenic process.
<BR><BR>Vitamin E supplementation has been shown to significantly reduce experimentally induced atherosclerosis in primates and more recent epidemiological and interventional human studies appear to support this observation.  This assumes greater
importance in those with diabetes, in view of the fact that as many as 60% of newly diagnosed diabetic patients already have clinically obvious cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR>A significantly lower risk of coronary artery disease was observed in a four year, prospective, observational study in healthy middle-aged men who had higher intakes of dietary vitamin E as compared to those consuming small amounts.
<BR><BR>In another prospective, epidemiological study, middle-aged women free of cardiovascular disease at baseline were found to have a highly significant reduced risk of coronary artery disease if they had been on vitamin E supplements for at least two
years during the eight year study.  In a more recent and similar seven year prospective study of postmenopausal women without cardiovascular disease, dietary vitamin E consumption, but not vitamin A or C, was inversely associated with the risk of death
from coronary artery disease.
<BR><BR>Perhaps the most powerful argument for vitamin E supplementation, at least, in those patients with already proven coronary artery disease, is the recently published Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study ("CHAOS").  The CHAOS was a nearly three year
prospective, secondary interventional trial of 2002 men and women, 10% of whom had diabetes, using natural vitamin E (free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol), 400 or 800 I.U.  daily, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded design.  Either dose of
vitamin E was associated with a dramatic and significant 77% risk reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarct.  The benefit of treatment with vitamin E was apparent after 200 days, and the patients with diabetes also enjoyed the marked reduction in the
risk of non-fatal heart disease.
<BR><BR>Another unrelated benefit of vitamin E supplementation is the favorable effect it has on insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism and lipid levels in both healthy subjects and patients with type II diabetes.  Conversely, in a prospective study of
almost one thousand non diabetic, middle-aged men, low concentration of plasma vitamin E at baseline was found to be an independent and powerful predictor for the development of type II diabetes during the four year study.  Remarkably, a low level of
vitamin E was associated with a greater than five-fold risk of developing diabetes in the ensuing four years!
<BR><BR>Vitamin E was well tolerated in the studies where it was given as a supplement, and in the CHAOS study there was no difference between the alpha tocopherol treatment (400 or 800 I.U.) or placebo groups for side effects.  Because of the unusually
high incidence of clinical heart disease in newly diagnosed diabetic patients, and the favorable effect vitamin E has on the metabolic abnormalities of type II diabetes, the present invention will contain preferably 400-800 I.U.; and most preferably
natural vitamin E (free 2R, 4'R, 8'R-alpha tocopherol) 400 I.U.
<BR><BR>Standardized Willow Bark (preferred range 160.00-320.00 mg.; most preferred dosage 160 mg (20mg aspirin))
<BR><BR>It is hard to imagine a more cost effective intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular events in either primary (no cardiovascular disease but high risk) or secondary (already have disease) patient groups than acetyl salicylic acid
(aspirin).  With the exception of successful lifestyle modification, no other treatment modality offers the economic benefits that simple aspirin does.  Indeed, it is estimated pharmaceutical costs alone would be reduced by $3 billion per year in this
country if the 15 million adults, many with diabetes, who qualify for hypolipidemic medication per NCEP guidelines were to first be given aspirin prophylaxis.
<BR><BR>The official American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines for the care of patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction call for aspirin intervention upon hospital discharge.  Yet, given the strong evidence for the
benefit of aspirin, a surprising number of patients are not afforded this effective and inexpensive treatment.
<BR><BR>The health promoting benefits of aspirin derive from its antiplatelet effect.  It works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of thromboxane, a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation, a condition known to be
increased in diabetes and to be causative in the atherosclerotic process.  In patients with diabetes, aspirin has been shown to correct this abnormal increase in platelet activity.
<BR><BR>The cardiovascular protective effect of aspirin in men and women with diabetes was demonstrated in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study.  Both type I and II patients were randomized to double-blinded placebo or aspirin (650 mg per day)
and followed-up for at least five years.  Aspirin use was associated with a significant reduction in fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and total mortality.
<BR><BR>Because aspirin in doses above 80 mg per day may interfere with the synthesis of prostaglandins necessary to protect the gastric mucosa, there is always the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with aspirin use above this dose.  Therefore, more
recent aspirin trials have used progressively smaller doses to avoid the risk of hemorrhage, and have found comparable suppression of thromboxane with doses as low as 10 mg per day, and with equal or greater risk reduction for cardiovascular end point.
<BR><BR>Because the present invention is a dietary supplement, it will contain standardized willow bark, a Chinese herb and a superior, highly standardized, non-drug source of aspirin.  The preferred range of standardized willow bark in the present
invention is 160-320 mg.; most preferably it is 160 mg (20 mg.  aspirin).
<BR><BR>Folic Acid (Folate) (preferred range 400-600 mcg; most preferred embodiment is 400 mcg).
<BR><BR>It is now well recognized that elevated blood homocysteine (a sulfhydryl-containing amino acid) levels are an independent and powerful cardiovascular risk factor.
<BR><BR>Homocysteine may injure arterial endothelial cells, affect platelet-endothelial cell interaction, and be thrombogenic.  All these effects clearly accelerate the artherogenic process in diabetic patients.  High homocysteine can often be normalized
by folic acid treatment, which, in patients with elevated homocysteine levels, can reduce arthersclerotic events.
<BR><BR>As with other anchor compounds, such as vanadium, the present invention can be practiced in the absence of folic acid, although the present invention will preferably contain 400-600 mcg folic acid, with the most preferred dose of 400 mcg.
<BR><BR>Alpha-Lipoic Acid (preferred dosage range 0-600 mg; most preferred embodiment 50 mg).
<BR><BR>Alpha-lipoic acid is one of the most powerful nutritional antioxidants and has long been recognized as a coenzyme needed to break down sugar (glucose) for energy production, thus playing an important role in the metabolism of glucose.
<BR><BR>Unique among the antioxidants, alpha-lipoic acid helps the body recycle and renew other antioxidants, e.g. vitamins C and E, Co-Q1O and glutathione.  It also neutralizes both oxygen and nitrogen free radicals, which play major causal roles in
cardiovascular diseases.
<BR><BR>More recently, it was shown that daily administration of alpha-lipoic acid to diabetic patients with neuropathy significantly reduces symptoms.  Diabetic neuropathy has been an unusually refractive complication of diabetes.
<BR><BR>The present invention will preferably contain 0-600 mg alpha-lipoic acid (based on the absence or presence of neuropathy), with the most preferred dose of 50 mg.
<BR><BR>These anchor compounds are most preferably combined with other vitamin and mineral supplements.  These additional ingredients are preferably included with the anchor compounds, and should be taken simultaneously.
<BR><BR>These other vitamins and minerals are also important in the metabolism of glucose and may be ingested from food or included in a supplement.  In order to be certain that sufficient amounts of the most important minerals and vitamins are
available, it is preferred that the supplement also include vitamin A (or beta carotene), vitamin C, calcium, copper, selenium, and zinc.
<BR><BR>It should be recognized that the amounts of these vitamins and minerals can vary widely within the scope of the present invention.
<BR><BR>One example of the preferred embodiment, the "Pro Health Pak," is distributed by Diabetes Pro Health of Pittsburgh, Pa.  Pro Health Pak consists of two major "components."The first, the so-called backbone of the supplement, is comprised of the
seven "anchor" compounds used in the human research studies that led to the development of Pro Health Pak and has been discussed in length previously in this application.  The second component is a "background" of a standardized, quality controlled
multivitamin/mineral formula which obviates the patient's need to take any additional supplements.  This "background" was necessary because many Americans, especially those on a restrictive caloric diet, do not eat a well balanced diet.
<BR><BR>Each dosage of the Pro Health Pak constitutes a packet containing 4 tablets: (anchor compounds in bold type, background ingredients in regular type)
<BR><BR>______________________________________ 3 tablets  Containing Chromium Polynicotinate and Picolinate, Vanadyl  Sulfate, Vitamin E Natural, Standardized Willow Bark (aspirin),  Folic Acid, Alpha-Lipoic Acid and  a Multivitamin/Mineral Formula  1
tablet  Containing Magnesium Complex consisting of Magnesium  Chloride, Citrate, Fumarate, Malate, Glutorate, and  Succinate Complex.  4 tablets  TOTAL  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>Specifically, each dose of the Pro Health Pak contains the following:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ Chromium Polynicotinate and Picolinate  200-1500 mcg.  Vanadyl Sulfate Hydrate  10-100 mg.  Vitamin E Natural (free 2R, 4'R  400-800 I.U.  8'R-alpha tocopherol)  Standardized Willow Bark  160-320 mg. 
(aspirin 20-40 mg.)  Magnesium Chloride, Citrate, Fumarate,  300-400 mg.  "common" Malate, Glutorate and  Succinate Complex  Folic Acid (Folate) 400-600 mcg  Alpha-Lipoic Acid 0-600 mg  Vitamin A or Beta Carotene  5000 I.U. or  25,000 I.U.  Vitamin C 60
mg.  Thiamine 3.00 mg.  Riboflavin 3.60 mg.  Niacinamide 20.10 mg.  Vitamin B-6 23.10 mg  Vitamin B-12 48.00 mcg.  Biotin 300 mcg.  Pantothenic Acid 10.00 mg.  Calcium 150 mg.  Phosphorus 115 mg.  Iodine 150 mcg.  Zinc 15.00 mg.  Selenium 60 mcg.  Copper
2.00 mg.  Manganese 11.00 mg.  Molybdenum 75 mcg.  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>Because Pro Health Pak is a dietary supplement, it will contain standardized willow bark, a Chinese herb and a superior, highly standardized, non-drug source of aspirin.  In view of the safety and efficacy of very-low dose aspirin, Pro Health Pak
will consist of standardized willow bark 160 mg (aspirin 20 mg).
<BR><BR>Pro Health Pak is a dietary supplement and should preferably be distributed in Nutrition Packs containing a 30 day supply.  The daily supplement is provided as an individual packet in which 4 tablets are enclosed.  Diabetes Pro Health provides to
the patient with diabetes or pre-diabetes a readily available and affordable and medically proven addition to their armamentarium for diabetes management, something which has been sorely lacking.  Pro Health Pak will be recommended for use in patients
with diabetes or pre-diabetes only as part of a complete diabetes treatment or prevention program, and will require regular blood glucose monitoring when used in the diabetic patient.
<BR><BR>Preliminary test results using the Pro Health Pak in over 100 patients with both type I and type II have shown a significant reduction in blood glucose levels, ranging from 30 mg/dl to as much as 115 mg/dl.  These reductions have been noted
within as little as two weeks from initiating the Pro Health Pak system to as long as a seven to twelve week period.  These patients have consistently noted a 19 to 47% drop in their baseline blood sugars following Pro Health Pak treatment, with the
average response being about a 30% reduction.  Likewise, the HbAlc levels have dropped a full point after just 3 months of Pro Health Pak use, with one patient having an amazing 8 point drop from his baseline HgAlc.  Generally, a 15% reduction in
baseline HbAlc is being reported, again, after only three months of treatment.
<BR><BR>One byproduct of treatment in this study has been the reduction of serum cholesterol.  Absolute reductions in serum cholesterol following Pro Health Pak have ranged from 20 to 67 mg/dl with an 11 to 27% decrease from baseline levels.
<BR><BR>Yet another benefit has been a drop in patient blood pressure levels.  The systolic drop in blood pressure has ranged from 20-30 mmHg, with a 10-22 mmHg drop in diastolic measurements.  Overall, there has been an 8-12% drop in blood pressure.
<BR><BR>In addition, most of the test patients have noted significant weight loss.  The absolute weight loss has ranged from 7-16 pounds, with an 8% loss of total body weight, despite patients not changing their dietary intake following the addition of
Pro Health Pak to their treatment program.
<BR><BR>Of course, it should be understood that various changes and modifications to the Pro Health Pak described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.  For instance, the aspirin component of the present invention need not be derived from
standardized willow bark, since some of the benefit sought can be supplied by acetyl salicylic acid derived from any source.  Nor do the advantages and uses of the present invention need to be limited to usage on diabetic patients--other patients can
easily benefit from the advantages offered by the unique combination of minerals, herbs and vitamins offered by the dietary supplement.  Such changes and modifications to the use and design of the present invention can be made without departing from its
the spirit and scope and without diminishing its attendant advantages.  It is, therefore, intended that all such changes and modifications be covered by the following claims.
