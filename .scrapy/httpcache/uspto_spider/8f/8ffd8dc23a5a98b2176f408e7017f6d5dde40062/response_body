<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin and marketed in the United States under the tradename RAPAMUNE.RTM.  (Wyeth, Collegeville, Pa.), is currently indicated for the prevention of organ rejection after kidney transplant.  Rapamycin derivatives
useful for prevention of organ rejection have also been developed.  For example, everolimus, marketed in the United States under the tradename CERTICAN.RTM.  (Novartis, East Hanover, N.J.) is indicated for the prevention of organ rejection after heart or
kidney transplantation.
<BR><BR> Rapamycin has demonstrated anti-proliferative effects and has been shown to inhibit the progression of dermal Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with kidney transplants.  S. DiPaolo, et al. Monitoring Antitumor Efficacy of Rapamycin in Kaposi Sarcoma,
American Journal of Kidney Diseases, vol. 49, issue 3, 462-470.  Rapamycin, in combination with doxorubicin, has been investigated for the treatment of melanoma.  M. Romano, et al. Rapamycin inhibits doxorubicin-induced NF-kB/Rel nuclear activity and
enhances the apoptosis of melanoma cells, European Journal of Cancer, vol. 40, issue 18, 2829-2836.  Such data has prompted researchers to investigate the anti-proliferative potential of rapamycin and its derivatives.  For example, temsirolimus, marketed
in the United States under the tradename TORISEL.RTM.  (Wyeth, Collegeville, Pa.), is currently indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.  Deforolimus is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies to evaluate deforolimus in patients with
breast, endometrial, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.  While these rapamycin derivatives have demonstrated efficacy in treating some types of cancer, more research and development is needed to improve efficacy and response and survival
rates.
<BR><BR> Chloroquine is a 4-amino-substituted quinoline that has been used for over 60 years for malaria prophylaxis and treatment, rheumatoid arthritis treatment, and HIV treatment.  Chloroquinoline derivatives such as hydroxylchloroquine are used to
treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis.  Recent studies indicate that chloroquine may inhibit cell growth and may induce cell death in lung cancer cells.  C. Fan, et al. Bioorg.  Med.  Chem. 2006 May 1; 14(9):3218-22.  In 2006,
researchers reported that adding chloroquine to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimes for glioblastoma multiforme might improve survival rates of cancer patients receiving standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Annals of Internal Medicine, 7
Mar.  2006, vol. 144, issue 5, 1-31.
<BR><BR> To date, there have been no reports of treating cancer in patients using a combination of a sirolimus drug and chloroquine or substituted quinoline.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> The present invention is directed to methods of simultaneously inducing and impairing the completion of cancer cell autophagy in a patient having or suspected of having a neoplasm.  The invention comprises co-administering to the patient a
sirolimus drug together with a substituted quinoline, the amounts of said sirolimus drug and substituted quinoline, in combination, being effective for limiting the growth and proliferation.  This combination effect can be measured, for example, by an
increase in autophagic vesicles in tumor tissue or surrogate tissue as compared to pretreatment samples or treatment with either a sirolimus drug or substituted quinoline alone.  Also within the scope of the invention are methods of treating cancer in a
patient comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a sirolimus drug and chloroquine or a substituted quinoline.  Pharmaceutical compositions and kits are also described. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR> While both sirolimus and chloroquine have been reported to independently exhibit antitumor activity, prior to the present disclosure, there have been no reports of methods of treating cancer using a combination of a sirolimus drug and
chloroquine (or a substituted quinoline).  As set forth herein, the effects of the combination of a sirolimus drug and chloroquine (or a substituted quinoline) results in an inhibition of cancer cell growth that is greater than the sum of the inhibition
of the individual molecules.  That is, the combination of a sirolimus drug and chloroquine (or a substituted quinoline) results in cancer cell growth inhibition that is greater than one skilled in the art would have expected, based on the cancer cell
inhibition effects of the sirolimus drug and chloroquine (or substituted quinoline) independently.
<BR><BR> While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is postulated that the combination of the sirolimus drug and chloroquine (or a substituted quinoline) results in simultaneous induction of autophagy (likely induced by the sirolimus
drug) and impairment of the clearance of accumulating autophagic vesicles (likely impaired by the chloroquine or substituted quinoline) leading to the accumulation of a greater number of ineffective autophagosomes, followed by cell death.

<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.  Such compositions are prepared in accordance with acceptable pharmaceutical procedures, such as described
in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, ed.  Alfonoso R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.  (1985).  Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents are those that are compatible with the other ingredients in the
formulation and biologically acceptable.
<BR><BR> The compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally, neat or in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers.  Applicable solid carriers can include one or more substances that may also act as flavoring agents,
lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents or an encapsulating material.  In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid that is in admixture with the finely divided active
ingredient.  In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.  The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active
ingredient.  Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and
ion exchange resins.
<BR><BR> Oral formulations are preferred.  Formulations for oral or injected use are based on sufficient solubility as to allow the therapeutic agent to enter solution in the stomach or in an injectable medium.  Suitable drug formulations include, but
are not limited to, tablets, pills, capsules, sachets, granules, powders, chewing gums, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories, and solutions.  Particularly preferred for oral use are tablets and capsules of all varieties and microbe-free solutions for
injection or infusion.  Where appropriate and necessary the formulations may include diluents, binding agents, dispersing agents, surface-active agents, lubricating agents, coating materials, flavoring agents, coloring agents, controlled release
formulations, sweeteners or any other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, for example, gelatin, sodium starch glycolate, lactose, starch, talc, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, Povidone, hydrogenated or unsaturated oils, polyglycols,
syrups or other aqueous solutions.  Where the formulations are tablets or capsules and the like the formulations may be presented as premeasured unit doses or in multidose containers from which the appropriate unit dose may be withdrawn.
<BR><BR> Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, and elixirs.  The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic
solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat.  The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents,
thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, or osmo-regulators.  Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives,
preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil).  For parenteral administration the carrier
can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate.  Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.
<BR><BR> Liquid pharmaceutical compositions, which are sterile solutions or suspensions, can be administered by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection.  Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously.  Oral
administration may be either liquid or solid composition form.
<BR><BR> The injectable form may be an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water or parenterally acceptable oils or mixture of liquids which may contain bacteriostatic
agents, antioxidants or other preservatives and stabilizers, buffers (preferably but not limited to a physiological pH range of 6.5-7.7, solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other
pharmaceutically acceptable additives.  Such forms will be presented in unit dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices or in multi-dose forms such as a bottle from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or as a solid form or
concentrate that can be used to quickly prepare an injectable formulation.  All formulations for injection are preferable as sterile and pyrogen free.  Suppositories containing the compound will also contain suitable carriers, e.g. cocoa butter,
polyglycols or other state-of-the-art carriers.
<BR><BR> Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in single unit dosage form, e.g. as tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or suppositories.  In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing
appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids.  The unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or
tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form.
<BR><BR> When the combination products are not formulated together in a single dosage form, the sirolimus drug and chloroquine, or substituted quinoline, may be administered at the same time or simultaneously (that is, together), or in any order.
<BR><BR> In addition to standard pharmaceutical additives there may be included within formulations of the compound other therapeutic agents.
<BR><BR> The dosage of the composition of the present invention that will be most suitable for prophylaxis or treatment will vary with the form of administration, the particular compounds chosen and the physiological characteristics of the particular
patient under treatment.  Generally, small dosages may be used initially and, if necessary, increased by small increments until the desired effect under the circumstances is reached.  Generally speaking, oral administration may require higher dosages.
<BR><BR> Preferably, administration of the combination products of the invention is oral, although other routes of administration, as described above, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.  Although it is preferable that the
sirolimus drug and chloroquine, or substituted quinoline, are all administered in the same fashion (that is, for example, both orally), if desired, they may each be administered in different fashions (that is, for example, one component of the
combination product may be administered orally, and another component may be administered intravenously).  The dosage of the combination products of the invention may vary depending upon various factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the
particular agent and its mode and route of administration, the age, health and weight of the recipient, the nature and extent of the symptoms, the kind of concurrent treatment, the frequency of treatment, and the effect desired.
<BR><BR> Although the proper dosage of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention will be readily ascertainable by one skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may range from
about 0.015 to about 1500 milligrams of the chloroquine or the substituted quinoline (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges therein) and about 0.001 to about 1000 milligrams of the sirolimus drug (and all combinations and subcombinations of
ranges therein) per kilogram of patient body weight.
<BR><BR> Particularly when provided as a single dosage form, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients.  For this reason, the preferred dosage forms of the combination products of this invention are
formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage form, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced).
<BR><BR> In order to minimize contact, one embodiment of this invention where the product is orally administered provides for a combination product wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated.  By enteric coating one or more of the active
ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not
released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines.  Another embodiment of this invention where oral administration is desired provides for a combination product wherein one of the active ingredients is coated with a sustained-release
material that effects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients.  Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such
that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine.  Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component
is also coated with a polymer such as a low-viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components.  The polymer coating serves to form an additional
barrier to interaction with the other component.
<BR><BR> Dosage forms of the combination products of the present invention wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated can be in the form of tablets such that the enteric coated component and the other active ingredient are blended together and then
compressed into a tablet or such that the enteric coated component is compressed into one tablet layer and the other active ingredient is compressed into an additional layer.  Optionally, in order to further separate the two layers, one or more placebo
layers may be present such that the placebo layer is between the layers of active ingredients.  In addition, dosage forms of the present invention can be in the form of capsules wherein one active ingredient is compressed into a tablet or in the form of
a plurality of microtablets, particles, granules or non-pareils, which are then enteric coated.  These enteric-coated microtablets, particles, granules or non-pareils are then placed into a capsule or compressed into a capsule along with a granulation of
the other active ingredient.
<BR><BR> In addition to providing for dosage forms wherein the pharmaceutically active components are presented in a single unit dosage form, kits including, for example, the sirolimus drug and the chloroquine (or substituted quinoline) as individual
components of the kit is also envisioned.  For example, one component of the kit can include a sirolimus drug and a first pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.  Another component of the kit can include chloroquine or a chloroquine
derivative and a second pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.  In such embodiments, each component of the invention can be presented together in, for example, a push-through or peel-open blister pack.  Other components of the kit
may include implements for administering each individual active component, for example, syringes, if the active component or components are to be administered by injection.
<BR><BR> The present invention is further defined in the following Examples.  It should be understood that these examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only.  From the above discussion and
these examples, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and
conditions.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Reagents and constructs: rapamycin (sirolimus, "rapa") and chloroquine (CQ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St.  Louis, Mo.).  The pC1-EGFP-LC3 vector was contributed by Dr. Mizushima (Japan).
<BR><BR> Cell lines, transfection, and cell counting: LN229 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Biosciences, Woodland, Calif.), 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen
Corporation).  LN229 cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer protocol.  Stable transfectants were selected with neomycin (Gibco), and high fluorescence clones of LN229 GFP-LC3 were selected by limiting
dilution.  For all in vitro experiments media+supplements and drugs treatments were changed daily.  Cell number was assessed by using a Coulter Z2 particle analyzer and confirmed by trypan blue exclusion.
<BR><BR> As depicted in FIG. 1, a combination of 5 nM rapamycin and 5 .mu.M chloroquine resulted in a decrease in cell number.  The decrease in cell number resulting from the combination of rapamycin and chloroquine was greater than the decrease in cell
number observed with either rapamycin or chloroquine alone.
<BR><BR> Fluorescence Microscopy: Cells were grown in sterile glass coverslips and treated in full medium as indicated above.  After 48 hours of treatment cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using a Nikon upright fluorescent microscope. 
Images were captured at 100.times.  and representative images were reported.
<BR><BR> As depicted in FIG. 2, LN229 cells, when treated with increasing doses of either rapamycin (top) or chloroquine (bottom) accumulated LC3-positive autophagosomes.
<BR><BR> Electron Microscopy: Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% formaldehyde with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and stored at 4.degree.  C. until embedding.  Cells were postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide followed by an increasing gradient
dehydration step using ethanol and propylene oxide.  Cells were then embedded in LX-112 medium (Ladd) and sections were cut ultrathin (90 nm), placed on uncoated copper grids, and stained with 0.2% lead citrate and 1% uranyl acetate.  Images were
examined with a JEOL-1010 electron microscope (JEOL) at 80 kV.  Cells were considered non-apoptotic if the integrity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic membrane were maintained.  Autophagic vesicles were identified as double-membrane vesicles.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts the electron micrographs of LN229 GFP-LC3 cells treated with either rapamycin, chloroquine, or the combination.  While autophagosomes are observed when cells are treated with either rapamycin or chloroquine alone, the combination
of rapamycin and chlorquine results in a greater number of autophagosomes.
