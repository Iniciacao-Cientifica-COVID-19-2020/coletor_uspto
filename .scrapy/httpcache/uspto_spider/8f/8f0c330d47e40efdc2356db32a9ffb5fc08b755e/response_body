       <p> The present invention relates to compounds which are salts of specialized
     pro-resolving mediators (referred to herein as "SPMs") which include
     lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and their <B><I>aspirin</I></B>-triggered
     counterparts. The SPM salts described here contain at least one or two
     SPM molecules ionically bound to at least one basic function that is
     provided by a scaffold moiety as described herein, compositions
     containing same, and methods of using same in the treatment of various
     diseases and disorders characterized by chronic or excessive
     inflammation, or both.

<CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to new chemical entities which are salt forms of lipid molecules, and their use.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The inflammatory response in animal tissues has two phases, initiation and resolution.  At the cellular level, initiation is characterized by edema and the accumulation of immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.  The
initiation phase of the inflammatory response has long been recognized as an active process driven by metabolites of arachidonic acid such as the prostaglandins PGE.sub.2 and PGD.sub.2, which are chemo-attractants for eosinophils, neutrophils and
monocytes, and the leukotrienes, especially LTB.sub.4 which elicit adhesion, chemotaxis, and aggregation of leukocytes.  In order for the inflamed tissue to return to a healthy state, the excess inflammatory cells, cellular debris, and other remnants of
the host defense and any invading microorganisms must be cleared.  This `resolution` phase of the inflammatory response was for many years believed to be a passive process, the result of the dilution of the chemo-attractants of the initiation phase. 
Today, resolution of inflammation is recognized as an active process, driven by various molecules.  For example, protectins and resolvins are autacoids produced locally at the site of inflammation.  They assist in resolving inflammation by recruiting
non-inflammatory monocytes which differentiate into macrophages that can remove excess neutrophils and cellular debris.  These molecules are part of a class of `specialized pro-resolving mediators` ("SPMs") of inflammation.  Other SPMs include lipoxins,
aspirin-triggered resolvins and aspirin-triggered protectins.  See Serhan et al., "Lipid Mediators of Inflammation", Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2015; 7:a016311.
<BR><BR> Excessive inflammation is widely recognized as a unifying component in many chronic diseases including vascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and neurological diseases.  See e.g., Serhan, C. N., Nature 2014 510:92-101.  Accordingly, the ability
to resolve excessive inflammation is of importance to human and animal health.
<BR><BR> Researchers have established a role for various SPMs in numerous disease models, including those relating to Alzheimer's disease, burn wounds, chronic pancreatitis, diabetic wounds, dermatitis, pulmonary inflammation, peripheral nerve injury,
obesity, allergic airway response, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, acute lung injury, fibrosis, bacterial infection, peritonitis, dry eye, tissue regeneration, pain, adipose tissue inflammation, localized aggressive periodontitis, colitis,
temporomandibularjoint inflammation, arthritis, postoperative pain, postsurgical cognitive decline, endotoxin shock, HSV-keratitis, allograft rejection, heart ischemia, bacterial pneumonia, cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation, vascular
inflammation, fibromyalgia, and vagotomy.  See e.g., Serhan et al., "Lipid Mediators of Inflammation", Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2015; 7:a016311.  U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  8,008,282 and 6,627,658 describe lipoxin analogs and their use as inhibitors of
angiogenesis.  U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,441,951, 5,648,512, 6,048,897, 6,316,648, 6,569,075, 6,887,901, 7,288,569, and 7,294,728, 7,741,369, and 7,741,369 describe lipoxin compounds and their use in treating cell proliferative disorders.  U.S.  Pat.  No.

<BR><BR> There is a need to develop compositions able to deliver SPMs and other lipid mediators of inflammation, including their analogs and derivatives, in therapeutically effective amounts to target tissues in order to fulfill the therapeutic promise
of these compounds and translate the many promising in vitro and cellular pharmacology observations into clinical benefits.  The present invention addresses these needs.

<BR><BR> Depending on the nature of the compounds and excipients making up the compositions described here, the composition may be suitable for pharmaceutical or veterinary use, or for use a dietary additive or supplement, or any combination of these
uses.  To the extent the various compositions are discussed in the following sections as "pharmaceutical compositions" or "additives and supplements" these terms are not meant to be limiting, only descriptive.
<BR><BR> The compositions described here may be formulated using one or more suitable excipients or carriers.  A suitable excipient or carrier is one suitable for human or animal use.  The term "excipient" refers to an additive that serves some purpose
in the composition other than a carrier, for example as a stabilizer, taste masking agent (e.g., a sweetener), solubilizing agent, or suspending agent.  Often, a carrier will serve a dual purpose as a simple carrier or diluent and an excipient.  Examples
of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may thus include carriers.  Non-limiting examples of excipients for use in the compositions of the invention include sterile liquids, water, buffered saline, ethanol, polyols (for example, glycerol, propylene
glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol and the like), oils, detergents, suspending agents, carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, lactose, sucrose or dextran), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid or glutathione), chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins, and
suitable mixtures thereof.
<BR><BR> A suitable excipient or carrier is typically a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient for use in animals or humans (or both).  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates approval by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state
government or listed in the U.S.  Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia such as the European Pharmacopeia, for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.  In the context of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, a
"carrier" refers to, for example, a solvent, a diluent, or vehicle with which the ionic salt of the invention is formulated for delivery.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in the compositions of the invention include, without
limitation, sterile aqueous and non-aqueous liquids, water, buffered saline, ethanol, polyols (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol and the like), and oils, for liquid dosage forms; or carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, lactose,
sucrose or dextran) for solid dosage forms.

<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the ophthalmic formulation comprises one or more of surfactants, tonicity agents, buffers, preservatives, co-solvents and viscosity building agents.  Various tonicity agents may be employed to adjust the tonicity of the
composition, preferably to that of natural tears for ophthalmic compositions.  For example, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, dextrose and/or mannitol may be added to the composition to approximate physiological
tonicity.  Preferably, the tonicity agent is present in an amount sufficient to cause the final composition to have an ophthalmically acceptable osmolality (generally about 150-450 mOsm, preferably 250-350 mOsm).  An appropriate buffer system (e.g.,
sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium borate or boric acid) may be added to the compositions to prevent pH drift under storage conditions.  The particular concentration will vary, depending on the agent employed.  Preferably, however,
the buffer will be chosen to maintain a target pH within the range of pH 6-7.5.
<BR><BR> Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients.  In general, the formulations are

<BR><BR>Example 15: Compounds of Formulas I and IV Show Increased Stability Against Degradation
<BR><BR> The stability of selected SPMs and their ionic derivatives based on Formulas I and IV was evaluated.  The parent SPM and its solid ionic derivative were place in open test tubes and maintained at room temperature between 68-72 F and relative
humidity between 20-40% for 6 or 8 weeks.  Qualitative demonstration of stability was determined using standard high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytic methods.  Briefly, HPLC analysis was performed on a PFP column (Poroshell 120, PFP,
4.6.times.150 mm, 2.7 m, Agilent), mounted on a Gilson HPLC system equipped with an ELS detector.  The mobile phase consisted of a gradient between solution A, water, and solution B, acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.  The gradient
program was 30-80% with respect to solution B. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The appearance of new HPLC peaks as compared to the baseline HPLC tracing at the initial time point is indicative of decomposition products and the lack of stability.  The
absence of such new HPLC peaks the subsequent time points is indicative of stability.
<BR><BR> At the initial time point, RvE1 elutes as a single major peak at retention time (rt) 7 minutes, with minor degradation products at 15 and 17.5 minutes (FIG. 1A).  Following 8 weeks exposure to the test conditions described above, RvE1 had
extensively degraded, as indicated by the appearance of multiple peaks corresponding to degradation products at rt 15 through 25 minutes (FIG. 1B).
<BR><BR> In contrast, under the same conditions, RvE1 magnesium (Mg) di-lysinate did not exhibit any degradation products.  At the initial time point, RvE1 Mg di-lysinate elutes as two peaks representing its dissociation into RvE1 (at rt 7 min.) and
lysine (at rt 3 min.) from the RvE1 Mg di-lysinate salt (compare FIGS. 2A and 2B).
<BR><BR> Similarly, the calcium (Ca) di-lysinate salt form of RvE1 exhibited the same enhanced stability profile observed for the Mg di-lysinate salt form (compare FIG. 3A to 3B).  In this example and as was observed for the Mg di-lysinate salt, at both
the initial time point and after 6 weeks of exposure to the test conditions, the compound elutes as two peaks, RvE1 (rt 7 min) and lysine (rt 3 min) relecting dissociation of the RvE1 Ca di-lysinate salt.  No additional peaks corresponding to degradation
products were observed.
<BR><BR> A representative compound of Formula I, a lysyl lysine (lys lys) salt form of RvE1, showed the same enhanced stability.  Like the compounds of Formula IV, at the initial time point, RvE1 lys lys elutes as two peaks, RvE1 (rt 7 min) and lysine
(rt 3 min) (FIG. 4A).  After 8 weeks under the test conditions described above, these same two peaks are present, without degradation products (FIG. 4B).
<BR><BR> In summary, these results show that the free acid form of RvE1 experienced significant degradation during 8 weeks of exposure to the test conditions (compare FIG. 1A to 1B), while representative compounds of Formulas I and IV having RvE1 as the
SPM component showed no degradation of the SPM under the same conditions for the same or similar periods of time.  These results indicate that compounds of Formulas I and IV can significantly improve the stability of the free acid form of an SPM that is
otherwise unstable under the conditions used here.
