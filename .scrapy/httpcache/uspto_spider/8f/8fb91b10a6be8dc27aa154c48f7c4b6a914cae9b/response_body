<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common neurologic disease that is a major cause of disability and economic loss, especially in young adults.  MS is confined to the central nervous system in which demyelination and inflammation in the brain, the
presence of oligoclonal bands, and activated cells in cerebrospinal fluid are characteristic features [28, 31, 34].  Extensive research has failed to identify the cause of MS.  Although many therapies have been used, none has significantly reduced
exacerbation rates, the accumulation of disability, and the increase in MS lesion burden as judged by cranial MRI.
<BR><BR>A recent multicenter epidermological study [36] has shown clear benefits of prolonged treatment of patients with MS with recombinant human beta-1 interferon (.beta.-IFN) [2, 10, 14, 27, 30].  These benefits are, however, limited so that the
conclusion has been drawn that ".beta.-IFN is not the long-awaited cure of M.S" [1].
<BR><BR>Antimalarial drugs [22, 23], such as chloroquine [25]and hydroxychloroquine, have been used for many years in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.  The effect of chloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis [39] has
been ascribed to an anti-inflammatory action mediated by an inhibition of the release of interleukin-1 from the monocytes [4, 5], however, this is not supported by recent investigations [5, 40].

<BR><BR>This invention is further illustrated in the Experimental Details section which follows.  This section is set forth to aid in an understanding of the invention but is not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit in any way the invention
as set forth in the claims which follow thereafter.
<BR><BR>EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
<BR><BR>Material and Methods
<BR><BR>Balb/C mice (8-12 weeks old) were obtained front the Jackson Laboratory.  Anti-V.beta.6 were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego).  All other staining reagents were prepared in as previously described [8].  Dead cells were excluded using
propidium iodide [29].  Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a dual laser FACStar.sup.plus (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose) using FACS/DESK data analysis software (Stanford University) [26] as previously described.
<BR><BR>Experiment 1: Demonstration of CD8+ T Cells that Selectively Kill CD4+ Target Lymphocytes that Express a Given Chain of the T Cell Receptor.
<BR><BR>Administration of the "superantigen" Enterotoxin B from Staphyloccus aureus (SEB) to adult mice, is regularly followed by a series of events that affect mostly the T lymphocytes that express receptors of the V.beta.8+ CD4+ T cells and a state of
non-reactivity of the remaining.  Collectively these events develop within 10-15 days [17] and determine a state of "tolerance" to the superantigen.  CD8+ T cells play a role in the negative immunoregulation (suppression) that follows one episode of
acute allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice by acting on the pathogenic CD4+ T cells [15], and therefore it was investigated whether these cells are also involved in the peripheral tolerance that follows treatment with SEB [19, 35].  Results indicated
that depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes completely eliminates the deletion of V.beta.8+ T cells induced by SEB.
<BR><BR>Depletion of CD8+ T cells was obtained with the administration of the monoclonal rat anti CD8+ antibody 53-6.72, a depletion which is almost complete, in the blood as well as in the lymphoid tissues, for over 10 days.  This time window of
antibody-mediated deplemion of CD8+ T cells is sufficient to cover the series of events that follow the administration of SEB in adult mice.
<BR><BR>Peripheral tolerance induced by SEB consists of two cellular events, as shown by other groups [17, 18, 33] T cell death, preceded by clonal expansion, and T cell anergy.  To test if CD8+ T cells are involved in SEB induced T cell death, 50 .mu.g
SEB was injected intravenously into both untreated and CD8+ T cell-depleted Balb/C mice, then the portion of V.beta.8.1,2+ CD4+ T cells (which are specifically interactive with SEB) in peripheral CD4+ T cells of those mice was determined.
<BR><BR>As shown by FIG. 1A and Table 1, in CD8+ T cell nondepleted, SEB primed group V.beta.8.1,2+ CD4+ T cells decreased from a day 4 of SEB injection, reached the lowest point between day 7 and day 14, and remained low for at least another week.  The
T cell death was preceded by expansion of the V.beta.8.1,2+ CD4+ T cell population which reached the peak on day 4.  On the other hand in CD8+ T cell depleted mice treated with SEB, the number of V.beta.8.1,2+ CD4+ T cells was increased after SEB
injection, reached the peak on day 4, and slowly returned to normal levels by day 14.  The fall below normal levels by day 14.  The fall below normal levels (25-28%) in the percentage of V.beta.8 1,2+ CD4+ T cells that is observed in normal mice treated
with SEB, was completely eliminated by depletion of CD8+ T cells.  Both SEB induced T cell death and the protection due to CD8+ T cell depletion are TCR V.beta.-specific, since there was no difference of the numbers of V.beta.6+ CD4+ T cell population
between CD8+ T cell non-depleted and CD8+ T cell depleted, SEB primed mice as shown in FIG. 1B.
<BR><BR>CD8+ T cell depletion protects V.beta.8.1,2+ CD 4+ T cells from SEB induced T cell death (FIGS. 1A and 1B).  Balb/C mice (8-12 weeks old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in the tail vein on day 1 with either 50 .mu.g SEB (Toxin Technology,
Madison, Wis.) in 0.1 ml PBS (SEB) or PBS alone (PBS).  Seven days before SEB/PBS injections one group of mice were CD8 T cell depleted.  On days 4, 7, 14 and 21 after peripheral blood drawn from the tail vein of 4-6 mice in each group was pooled,
mononuclear cells purified on a lymphocyte separation medium gradient (Organon Technicka) and stained with the following monoclonal antibodies: fluorescein 53-6.72 [anti-CD8] [20]; Allophycocyanin GK1.5 [anti-CD4] [6]; and biotin KJ-16
[anti-V.beta.8.1,2] [16] or biotin RR4.7 [anti-V.beta.6] [9].  Biotin conjugates were revealed with Texas Red-Avidin.
<BR><BR>The data is expressed as the percent of total CD4+ or total CD8+ T cells.  The values for day 1 are the average of &gt;50 normal animals.  For days 4, 7, 14 and 21, each point represents the average of three separate experiments with 4-6 mice per
group per experiment.  The group designations are: CD8+/PBS, PBS-primed, CD8 T cell non-depleted; CD8-/PBS, PBS-primed, CD8 T cell depleted; CD8+/SEB, SEB-primed, CD8 T cell non-depleted; CD8-/SEB, SEB-primed, CD8 T cell depleted.
<BR><BR>The fact that the death of V.beta.8+ CD 4+ T cells that follows the initial expansion of these cells in mice treated with SEB requires the presence of CD8+ T cells indicates that the V.beta.8 CD4+ T cells that were stimulated by SEB in the first
place induced a population of CD8+ killers with anti V.beta.  specificity (distinct from the V.beta.8 CD8+ cells directly stimulated by SEB), that was ultimately responsible for the partial deletion of V.beta.8+ CD 4+ T cells.

as in FIGS. 1A-1B.  Each value represents (average.+-.Standard Deviation) data from 12-18 mice of three separate experiments (4-6 mice per experiment).
<BR><BR>Results indicate that directly show specific killing in vitro of syngeneic CD4+V.beta.8+ T cells by lines of CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from the spleens of mice primed two weeks previously with SEB.
<BR><BR>Experiment 2: Establishing Different CD4+V.beta.8+ T Cell Lines in B10PL Mice
<BR><BR>CD4+ T cells are purified from spleen and lymphnodes of B.10.PL mice by depleting B cells and CD8+ T cells with rat anti-mouse Mab 53-6.72 and goat anti-rat coated magnetic beads.  CD4+ V.beta.8+ and CD4+ V.beta.8- T cells are obtained by
staining the CD4+ T cells with anti-mouse V.beta.8 Mab F23.1 and being separated by goat anti-mouse coated beads.  CD4+ and V.beta.8.2+ T cells and mixture of CD4+ V.beta.8+ and CD4+ V.beta.8.3+ T cells are obtained from the mixture of these two types of
the cells by using anti-mouse V.beta.8.1 and V.beta.8.2 Mab KJ-16.  The phenotypes of the CD4+ T cell lines are as follows:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ F23.1 KJ-16 F23.2  ______________________________________ V.beta.8-  - - - V.beta.8+  + + +  V.beta.8.1  + + -  V.beta.8.2  + + +  V.beta.8.3  + - -  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>The purified CD4+ T cells bearing different TCR V.beta.8 chains are stimulated by SEB and APC and used as vaccines to be injected into B.10.  PL mice.
<BR><BR>Vaccinating B.10.PL Mice:
<BR><BR>1.times.10.sup.6 vaccinating T cells are irradiated (3000R) and injected into B.10.PL mice intravenously; 7 days later, the vaccinated mice are challenged with 1-9 Nac of MBP peptide as indicated before.  The protective effect of vaccination by
CD4+ V.beta.8+ T cells is assessed by comparing EAE symptoms of mice vaccinated with V.beta.8+ or V.beta.8-, CD4 T cells and unvaccinated mice.  To prove that the protective effect is CD8+ T cell mediated, one group of B.10.PL mice is depleted of CD8+ T
cells 7 days after T cell vaccination and used as control.  To check if the protective effect is V.beta.8 family specific or only V.beta.8.2 specific, different V.beta.8+ T cell lines are used as vaccines.  The protective effect is assayed by the
comparison of EAE symptoms of different groups.
<BR><BR>Effect of .beta.-IFN on isolated CD8+ T cells
<BR><BR>CD8+ T cells are isolated using magnetic beads, and checked by FACS.  The cells are then incubated with .beta.-IFN for 48 hours, either alone or in the presence of Con-A plus APC (adherent cells deprived of lymphocytes).  The capacity of these
cells to suppress the proliferation of T cells is then tested and compared with that of parallel cultures to which .beta.-IFN had not been added.
<BR><BR>Experiment 3: Demonstration that Chloroquine Eliminates the Resistance of Activated T Cells to the Kill by the CD8+ T Cells
<BR><BR>Six groups of Balb/c mice (6 mice each) were treated (FIG. 2) as follows: 1) daily injections of PBS (phosphate buffered saline) for 14 days (.circle-solid.--.circle-solid., Control) 2) daily injections of 1 mg Chloroquine base (0 ----0, CHQ) 3)
One i.v.  injection of 50 .mu.g SEB on day 0 (.sub..DELTA.  --.sub..DELTA., SEB) 4) daily injections of 1 mg chloroquine base, plus one i.v.  injection of 50 .mu.g SEB on day 0 (x----x, SEB-CHQ) 5) 50 .mu.g SEB on day 0 mice depleted of CD8+ T cells,
depletion performed as described in reference 4 (.quadrature.----.quadrature., CD8 depleted SEB) 6) 50 .mu.g SEB on day 0 in mice depleted of CD8+ T cells and treated with daily injections of 1 mg chloroquine base (.dagger.----.dagger., CD8

__________________________________________________________________________
<BR><BR>The effects of these treatments on the percentage of CD4+ cells expressing V.beta.8+ T cell receptor chain are shown in FIG. 2 and Table 2.  It is apparent that chloroquine alone did not affect the T cells.  SEB alone induced an increase of
V.beta.8+ CD 4+cells, followed by a fall, as in the previous experiments (see FIGS. 1A-1B).  Chloroquine treatment eliminated the initial increase and enhanced the subsequent fall; this effect of chloroquine was completely dependent of the presence of
CD8+ T cells.  In essence, treatment with chloroquine greatly enhances the killing of CD4+ cells by the CD8+ T cells, as induced by priming with the superantigen SEB, even in the first days after priming when, normally, the CD4+cells appear resistant to
this killing.  This experiment was repeated with mice treated with a lower dose of chloroquine (0.2 mg/day), with similar results.
<BR><BR>Experiment 4: Simultaneous Treatment with Drugs that Stimulate CD8+Suppressor T Cells and Chloroquine in Human Autoimmune.  Diseases.
<BR><BR>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
<BR><BR>The limitation of the therapeutic effects of long-term treatment of MS with .beta.-IPN (a CD8+ T cell stimulator) is due to the resistance of activated pathogenic CD4+ cells to the suppressive (killing) action of CD8+ T cells and that maximum
benefits is obtained by eliminating this resistance with the usage of chloroquine.
<BR><BR>In addition to continuous treatment with .beta.-IFN, MS patients receive hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil.TM.) by mouth in a dosage of 400 mg/day or 10 kg/day for periods not to exceed 3-4 weeks at intervals of about 2 months, and anyway during the
relapses of the disease.  This dosage corresponds to the one given for prolonged period for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and to that employed in the hereinabove mouse experiments where an abrogation of the resistance of the
superantigen-activated CD4+ T cells to the deletion by CD8+ suppressors was detected.  This dosage provides a molar concentration of chloroquine in the body sufficient to interfere with the endosome function and therefore with the process of Class I MHC
recycling in activated T cells, a process that may provide resistance of these cells to the effect of the TCR-restricted CD8+ killer/suppressors.
<BR><BR>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
<BR><BR>In RA subjects, administration of both chloroquine and .beta.-IFN is a treatment of choice.  In the first treatment one may consider chronic treatment with .beta.-IFN for periods and with a dosage already experimented in MS patients with added
periods of a few weeks of hydroxychloroquine to provide suitable targets for the population of CD8 killers raised by .beta.-IFN.
<BR><BR>Use of chloroquine to augment the efficacy of treatments involving "T cell Vaccination"
<BR><BR>Animal experiments [3, 12, 21, 24] have shown that "vaccination" with CD4+ T cell lines or clones whose pathogenic capacity had been inactivated with glutaraldehyde fixation or high hydrostatic pressure could stimulate "anti-idiotypic" or
"anti-ergothypic" CD8+ T cells capable of exerting a protective effect in the experimental disease.  The medical procedure, in humans, which is closer to "T cell vaccination" is that of "photopheresis," that involves oral administration of
8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) to patients, the extracorporeal irradiation with low-energy U.V.  light of the lymphocytes from about 500 ml of bloods and their reinfusion in the patient.
<BR><BR>The main target of this procedure has been the treatment of cutaneous lymphoma (Sezary's syndrome), a malignancy of CD4+ T cells.  Subjects are treated with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg base equivalent/day) for a period of one-two weeks after the
photopheresis treatment may provide the necessary sensitivity of the CD4+ T lymphoma cells to the killing action of the CD8+killers induced by the "T cell vaccination," necessary to obtain good results in a higher number of patients.  It is interesting
to point out that the cells of cutaneous lymphomas tend to express a limited range of T cell receptor variable region chains [13], and are therefore appropriate targets for V.beta.-restricted CD8+ killers, as discussed in the previous sections.
<BR><BR>Experiment 5: Demonstration that CTCL Subjects Treated with Photopheresis, Manifest CD8+ T Lymphocytes Capable of Exerting a Cytotoxic Effect on the CTCL Cells
<BR><BR>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CTCL patients at 5.times.10.sup.5 cells/ml in RPM1 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 nanograms/ml human recombinant IL-7 are cultured (rIL-7 is available from GIBCO and medium changes and
maintenance of the lines are done according to Dalloul et al [26].  The lines are characterized by membrane staining and analysis with the fluorescence activated cell sorter and should show the expected CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD7- phenotype of Sezary cells. 
In addition the restriction of expression of the TCR chain is also be assessed on the cell lines by membrane staining with a panel of anti V.beta.  antibodies (available from MAC Inc., Westbrood, Me.).  In addition, the cells are flattened on glass
slides, stained with May-Grunwald-Giemse and those with the morphology of Sezary cells are counted.
<BR><BR>These cells are then labeled with .sup.51 Cr and used as targets of autologous CD8+ T cells in a standard chromium-release assay.  The target T cells form the Sezary line are labeled with 200 .mu.l of .sup.51 Cr for one hour, washed three times
and incubated with the autologous CD8+ T cells at various effector/target cells ratio for four or eight hours.  After the incubation the supernatant is harvested and radioactivity counted on a gamma counter (LKB) Y. The mean of triplicate samples are
calculated and percent of .sup.51 Cr release is determined as follows: % of .sup.51 Cr release=100 [(experimental .sup.51 Cr release-control Cr release)/(maximum, .sup.51 Cr release-control Cr release)]. Experimental .sup.51 Cr release represents counts
from target T cells mixed with effector T cells; control .sup.51 Cr release represents counts from targets incubated with medium alone (spontaneous release); maximum .sup.51 Cr release represents counts from targets exposed to 5% Triton X-100.
<BR><BR>Isolation of CD8+ T cells from the blood of CTCL patients
<BR><BR>The study group is comprised of male and female subjects over 18 years of age.  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test upon entrance to the study and agree to use an active form of birth control.
<BR><BR>Subjects with CTCL currently receiving photopheresis are eligible to enter the study.  Subjects receiving adjunctive treatment for CTCL (interferon, methotrexate, etc.) and subjects who are currently participating in other clinical trials are not
eligible.  Subjects who have contraindications to hydroxychloroquine (G6PD neg, abnormal eye exam) are not eligible.
<BR><BR>The criteria used for assessing clinical effect is be a "skin score." The body surface is divided into specific quadrants.  Each quadrant is assessed according to the following severity score:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ 0 - Normal Skin  0.5 - Few scattered erythematous papules  1 - Minimal erythema and edema  No scale or fissuring  2 - Substantial erythema and edema  No fissuring or ectropion  3 - Subreaxial erythema,
Scaling and edema  No fissuring or ectropion  4 - Most severe, universal involvement with  maximal erythema, edema and scale;  Fissuring or ectropion may be present  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>Each quadrant has an estimated percentage of surface area.  This percentage is multiplied by the severity score for that area which gives a "regional score." Finally, all "regional scores" are added to obtain an "over score.  "
<BR><BR>Subjects receive one photopheresis treatment on two consecutive days every four weeks as usual.  On weeks two and three of each treatment cycle (the two weeks between photopheresis) the patients are to receive 400 mg per day of hydroxychloroquine
for three cycles.  T cell marker studies on peripheral blood are done monthly starting two months prior to the administration of hydroxychloroquine and continuing until two months after the last dose of hydroxychloroquine.
<BR><BR>Assessment of a patients' skin score is made prior to each treatment cycle starting two months prior to the administration of hydroxychloroquine and continuing two months after the last dose of hydroxychloroquine.
<BR><BR>Subjects blood is obtained four days after photopheresis during the months that hydroxychloroquine has been administered, and the mononuclear cells are separated by the standard phycoll-hypaque procedure.  The cells are first depleted of adhering
cells and B lymphocytes are separated by incubation with goat anti human immunoglobulin-coated beads (Advanced Magnetics, Inc.) at a ratio of 10 7/ml beads for 30 minutes at 40.degree.  C. The cells are separated from the beads by a Bio Mag Separator
(Advanced Magnetics, Inc.) and the unbound cells are then positively selected for CD8+ lymphocytes by incubating with 0.1 ml of 1:40 sites of OK-T8 ATCC (anti-human CD8 hybridoma) for 30 min washing three times, and incubating with goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin coated beads for 30 minutes at 40.degree.  C. The beads separated at 37.degree.  C. and cleared from the cells that have now fallen off from the beads, by Bio Mag Separator again.  The final purified population is essentially CD8+ T
lymphocytes.  These cells are immediately tested for cytotoxic activity against the aunologous Chromium-labeled Sezary cell lines (at various effector/target cell sections) as requested above.
<BR><BR>Control cells are Chromium-labeled T cell lines (Jurkat and Molt.sup.-3) as well as autologous B cell lines established by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus.
<BR><BR>The effect of hydroxychloroquine on the sensitivity of the cells of the continuous Sezary line to the cytotoxic effect of the autologous CD8+ T cells is tested.  Short term .sup.51 Cr release assay is done using labeled target cells previously
treated for various periods of time with 50 mM hydroxychloroquine.  Experiments are also done incubating the target and the effector cells in the presence of hydroxychloroquine.
<BR><BR>Discussion
<BR><BR>It has been established [11, 37, 38] that activated T cells spontaneously internalize their membrane Class I MHC molecules into acidic endosomes and then recycle them to the surface.  The physiological significance of this massive cellular event
(about on half of all Class I MHC molecules are recycled every hour in an activated T cell) has never been established.  It has, however, been established [32, 38] that chloroquine blocks this recycling, presumably by neutralizing the acidic endosomes.
<BR><BR>The experiments described in the preceding sections offer an understanding of the functional role of the recycling of Class I MHC molecules in activated T cells: In essence this cellular event protects the activated cells from the killing by CD8+
(suppressor) cells.  Chloroquine, in concentrations sufficient to block the Class I recycling, eliminates this protection.  The cytoplasm of murine T cells stimulated in vitro with the superantigen SEB has been examined by immunofluorescence and results
indicated that after 3 days of culture there is a peak of endocytic activity with about 50% of all the cells (and most of the blasts showing Class I MHC in the endosomes; 80%, at least, of these cells appear to belong to those that express the V.beta.8
TCR chain because they also show the presence of these molecules in the endosomes that contain Class I MHC.  In the following clays the endocytic activity declines.
<BR><BR>There is therefore a parallel between the recycling of Class I MHC seen in T cells stimulated with SEB and their increase in numbers, supporting the hypothesis that this activity protects the cells from killing by CD8+, a protection that, as
already said, is abrogated by chloroquine.
<BR><BR>The combined approach of hydroxychloroquine and IFN-.beta.  to the treatment of MS, provides periods in which the activated pathogenic cells responsible for the autoimmunity are (by chloroquine) made fully sensitive to the kill by the population
of CD8+ killers that have been recruited with the treatment with .beta.-IFN.  Treatment of MS with chloroquine alone is of use, but only in those patients and in those periods where CD8+ suppressor T cells are not depressed, as they often are in MS. 
Treatment with chloroquine considerably increases the susceptibility of pathogenic CD4+ T cells to the killing by CD8+ T cells.  On the other side treatment with .beta.-IFN alone may have its therapeutic effects limited by the resistance of the
activated, pathogenic, CD4+ T cells.  Therefore, treatment with chloroquine is more effective if performed in conjunction with a stimulant of CD8+ T cells, like .beta.-IFN.
