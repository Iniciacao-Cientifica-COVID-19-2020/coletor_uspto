<BR><BR>1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR> The present disclosure is generally directed to methods of treating hyperglycemia, such as diabetes mellitus, with a combination of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor.
<BR><BR>2.  Description of Related Art
<BR><BR> Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which a person's body does not produce enough, or does not properly respond to, insulin.  Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that enables cells to absorb glucose to turn it into energy.  When
insulin production is insufficient or when the body does not properly respond to insulin, glucose accumulates in the blood, which can lead to various complications.  While there are several forms of diabetes, three forms are the most recognized: type I
diabetes, type II diabetes, and gestational diabetes.  Additionally, prediabetes is recognized s preceding diabetes and exists when blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.
<BR><BR> Type I diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a metabolic disorder caused by destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, which leads to insulin deficiency and high levels of glucose in plasma.  The onset
of type I diabetes generally results from an autoimmune etiology; however, idiopathic causes of beta cell destruction can occur for type I. Type 1 diabetes can affect children or adults, but was traditionally termed "juvenile diabetes" because it
represents a majority of the diabetes cases in children.
<BR><BR> Type II diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has been found to possess inheritable aspects which can be greatly impacted by external environmental factors.  The underlying etiologies of type II diabetes include
deficiencies in insulin-producing beta cells; altered response to insulin by muscle, adipose, and liver cells; and abnormalities in the regulating mechanisms responsible for controlling carbohydrate and lipid metabolism following ingestion of food. 
Modulation in insulin-sensitivity is affected by environmental factors and behaviors, mostly a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.  The cellular mechanisms that contribute to modulation of muscle and adipose cell sensitivity to insulin are complex and are
not well understood.  It is believed that altering insulin signaling pathways, increasing the amount of intracellular fat, and elevating levels of free fatty acids and other adipose tissue products can impact insulin-sensitivity.
<BR><BR> Gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women who have not previously been diagnosed with diabetes but who have high glucose levels during pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes affects about 4% of all pregnant women and may precede development of
type II diabetes.
<BR><BR> If not properly controlled or stabilized, a hyperglycemic state has been associated with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, vision impairment, various forms of neuropathy and cognitive impairment, stroke, and peripheral vascular
disease.  The common therapeutic approach, in addition to major modifications in an individual's dietary nutrition and physical activity, includes the use of anti-hyperglycemic drugs and insulin.  Since the disease is chronic and progressive, and so far
no treatment is able to reverse the progression, and thus there remains in this field a need of an improved medicament for treating conditions, diseases and/or disorders associated with hyperglycemia.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader.  This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key/critical elements of the present
invention or delineate the scope of the present invention.  Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a medicament, which effectively reduces the blood glucose level of a hyperglycemia subject.  The present invention therefore is useful for treating conditions related to hyperglycemia, which includes, but is not
limited to, type I, type II diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, other forms of diabetes and/or disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, one aspect of the present disclosure relates to the combined use of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for the

<BR><BR> For convenience, certain terms employed in the specification, examples and appended claims are collected here.  Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of the
ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
<BR><BR> The singular forms "a", "and", and "the" are used herein to include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  The term "about" as used herein generally means within 10%, 5%, 1%, or 0.5% of a given value or range. 
Alternatively, the term "about" means within an acceptable standard error of the mean when considered by one of ordinary skill in the art.  Other than in the operating/working examples, or unless otherwise expressly specified, all of the numerical
ranges, amounts, values and percentages such as those for quantities of materials, durations of times, temperatures, operating conditions, ratios of amounts, or reflection angles disclosed herein should be understood as modified in all instances by the
term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present disclosure and attached claims are approximations that can vary as desired.  At the very least, each numerical parameter should at least be
construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
<BR><BR> The term "diabetes mellitus" refers to type I, type II diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, and other forms of diabetes.  Other forms diabetes may be latent autoimmune diabetes of adult (LADA), congenital diabetes, steroid diabetes,
pancreatic defects related diabetes (e.g., chronic pancreatitis related diabetes, cystic fibrosis related diabetes, pancreatic neoplasia related diabetes, hemochromatosis related diabetes, and fibrocalculous pancreatopaty related diabetes),
endocrinopathy related diabetes (e.g., acromegaly related diabetes, Crushing syndrome related diabetes, hyperthyroidism related diabetes, pheochromocytoma related diabetes, and glucagonoma related diabetes), infection related diabetes (e.g.,
cytomegalovirus infection related diabetes, and coxackievirus B related diabetes), diabetic angiopathy (e.g., diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy), and drug related diabetes (e.g., glucocorticoids related diabetes, thyroid hormone related
diabetes, .beta.-adrenergic agonists related diabetes, and statins related diabetes).  Frequently correlated with type II diabetes mellitus are one or more of the metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and a pathological glucose
tolerance.  Subjects with diabetes mellitus manifest varying degrees of increased blood pressure, increased levels of cholesterol and/or triglycerides, increased levels of uric acid and increased levels of factors that promote coagulation.  Therefore,
"disorders related to diabetes mellitus" as used herein refers to hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, gout and hypercoagulability, i.e. an abnormal, increased tendency to form clots inside blood vessels.  These disorders are well-recognized risk
factors for atherosclerotic macrovascular as well as microvascular diseases.  Atherosclerotic macrovascular diseases include myocardial infarction, stroke and limb amputation.  Microvascular complications involve blindness, renal diseases and
debilitating neuropathies.
<BR><BR> The term "treatment" as used herein are intended to mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and/or physiologic effect, e.g., reducing blood glucose level in a hyperglycemia subject.  The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or
partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease.  "Treatment" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, preventative (e.g.,
prophylactic), curative or palliative treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly human; and includes: (1) preventative (e.g., prophylactic), curative or palliative treatment of a disease or condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus or disorders related
thereto) from occurring in an individual who may be pre-disposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (2) inhibiting a disease (e.g., by promoting the proliferation of insulin-producing beta cells or suppressing apoptosis of these
cells); or (3) relieving a disease (e.g., reducing symptoms associated with the disease).
<BR><BR> The term "administered", "administering" or "administration" are used interchangeably herein to refer a mode of delivery, including, without limitation, orally, intraveneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intraarterially, intracranially,
transmucosally (e.g., inhalation, and intranasally), or subcutaneously administering of an agent (e.g., a compound or a composition) of the present invention.  In preferred embodiments, the compound of the present disclosure (i.e., (R)-(+)-verapamil and
.alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor) is formulated into compositions that are suitable for oral administration.
<BR><BR> The term "an effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount effective, at dosages, and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired result with respect to the treatment of a disease resulted from hyperglycemia.  For example, in
the treatment of diabetes mellitus, an agent (i.e., the present compound) which decrease, prevents, delays or suppresses or arrests any symptoms related to diabetes mellitus would be effective.  An effective amount of an agent is not required to cure a
disease or condition but will provide a treatment for a disease or condition such that the onset of the disease or condition is delayed, hindered or prevented, or the disease or condition symptoms are ameliorated.  The specific effective or sufficient
amount will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient (e.g., the patient's body mass, age, or gender), the type of mammal or animal being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of
concurrent therapy (if any), and the specific formulations employed and the like.  Effective amount may be expressed, for example, as the total mass of the active agent (e.g., in grams, milligrams or micrograms) per day.  The effective amount may be
divided into one, two or more doses in a suitable form to be administered at one, two or more times throughout a designated time period.
<BR><BR> The term "subject" or "patient" is used interchangeably herein and is intended to mean a mammal including the human species that is treatable by the compound of the present invention.  The term "mammal" refers to all members of the class
Mammalia, including humans, primates, domestic and farm animals, such as rabbit, pig, sheep, and cattle; as well as zoo, sports or pet animals; and rodents, such as mouse and rat.  Further, the term "subject" or "patient" intended to refer to both the
male and female gender unless one gender is specifically indicated.  Accordingly, the term "subject" or "patient" comprises any mammal which may benefit from the treatment method of the present disclosure.  Examples of a "subject" or "patient" include,
but are not limited to, a human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, pig, goat, cow, horse, dog, cat, bird and fowl.  In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.
<BR><BR> The term "excipient" as used herein means any inert substance (such as a powder or liquid) that forms a vehicle/carrier for the active agent.  The excipient is generally safe, non-toxic, and in a broad sense, may also include any known substance
in the pharmaceutical industry useful for preparing pharmaceutical compositions such as, fillers, diluents, agglutinants, binders, lubricating agents, glidants, stabilizer, colorants, wetting agents, disintegrants, and etc.
<BR><BR> The term "racemic" as used herein refers to a mixture of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, or stereoisomers, of verapamil, in which neither enantiomer or stereoisomer is substantially purified from the other.
<BR><BR> II.  Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders Related thereto
<BR><BR> 2.1 Treatment Methods
<BR><BR> Verapamil (e.g., 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl-methylamino]-2-pr- opan-2-ylpentanenitrile) is a known drug with various medicinal indications.  Traditionally, it is used for treating coronary disease, such as
hypertension.  The compound has a stereogenic center, hence can be separated into its optical enantiomers.  The (S)-enantiomer is known to possess the majority of the calcium channel antagonist activity, whereas the (R)-enantiomer is known to possess
agonist activity toward somatostatin receptor 2, and antagonist activity toward orexin receptors 1 and 2, dopamine D.sub.2L receptor, sodium and calcium channels (see WO 2011/057471A1); accordingly, the (R)-enantiomer is useful as a medicament for
treating diseases or conditions related to these receptors in a human subject.
<BR><BR> The present invention in general, relates to the combined use of (R)-(+)-verapamil and an .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor, in which the combination is capable of reducing both the non-fasting and the 6-hrs fasting blood glucose level in a diabetic
subject.  Accordingly, the (R)-(+)-verapamil and the .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor, may be manufactured into a medicament for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> In this regard, a particular aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a subject suffering from diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.  The method includes the step of, administering to the subject an effective
amount of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (i.e., (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl) and an .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor, so as to ameliorate or alleviate symptoms associated to diabetes mellitus and/or disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil may be obtained from racemic mixture of verapamil by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation or resolution of the enantiomers using any available means, such as optically active resolving acid.  Alternatively,
(R)-(+)-verapamil may be synthesized by stereospecific synthesis using any method known in the related art.  Stereospecific synthesis in general can result in products with high enantiomeric purity.  In cases when the enantiomeric purity is not
sufficient, then the synthetic product may be subject to further purification process to enhance the enantiomeric purity by separating (R)-(+)-verapamil from (S)-(-)-verapamil.  Examples of processes for resolving racemic verapamil to produce
(R)-(+)-verapamil are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR> According to some preferred embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in a crystalline form.  The crystalline of (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be
produced by any known crystallization method, e.g., saturation method.  In one example, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl is dissolved in suitable solvent(s), which include but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane/heptane (1:1), until a
saturated solution is obtained; the saturated solution is then cooled to form (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl crystals therefrom.
<BR><BR> According to preferred embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil suitable for use in the present invention is in the form of hydrochloride salt, that is, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl.
<BR><BR> According to preferred embodiments, the (R)-(+)-verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered with an .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor to ameliorate or alleviate the hyperglycemia state of the subject.
<BR><BR> Suitable examples of the .alpha.-glycosidase inhibitor include, but are not limited to, acarbose, miglitose, and voglibose.
<BR><BR> According to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl and acarbose are respectively administered to the subject to ameliorate or alleviate the hyperglycemia state of the subject.

<BR><BR> The present invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the following examples.  However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specified examples.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Materials.
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl and racemic verapamil HCl were respectively provided by Center Laboratories Inc (Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.).  Glucometer was purchased from Abbott (USA).  Glucose assay kits were purchased form Denka Seiken Co.  Ltd (Tokyo,
Japan).  Insulin and acarbose were both from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), and HbA1c assay kits were from Fujirebio (Japan).
<BR><BR> Animals.
<BR><BR> Wide-type male C57BL/6 mice (each weighted about 20-25 g), non-insulin dependent diabetic mellitus (NIDDM) male db/db mice (C57BLKS/J lar-+Lepr.sup.db/+Lepr.sup.db, each weighted about 45.+-.10 g) were used in the present study.
<BR><BR> C57BL/6 mice were provided by BioLASCO Taiwan (authorized by Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, Mass.).
<BR><BR> NIDDM mice were provided by Institute for Animal Reproduction (IAR, Japan).  They exhibited hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and islet atrophy and were used at about 9-10 weeks of age.  These animals were housed singly in Individually Ventilated
cages Racks (IVC Racks, 36 Mini Isolator systems (Tecniplast, Italy) throughout the study.
<BR><BR> All were maintained in the animal facility with controlled temperature (20-24.degree.  C.), humidity (50-80%) and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (light on at 7:00 a.m.) with food and water provided ad libitum.  Experimental procedures for handling
the mice complied with relevant regulations set forth in "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition" (National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2011) in AAALAC-accredited laboratory animal facility.  (Eurofins Panlabs Taiwan,
Ltd.)
<BR><BR> NIDDM Mice and Treatment
<BR><BR> NIDDM mice were acclimated at least one week and then grouped for treatment when the average blood glucose value was .gtoreq.250 mg/dl after 6-hr fasting.  Test compounds (i.e., verapamil HCl in racemic form (VPM, bid), (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl
(R-VPM, bid), acarbose (once daily, qd), or the combination of R-VPM (bid) and acarbose (qd) at the designated dose was orally fed to each mice from day 1, and continued for 16 consecutive days to day 17.  Non-fasting blood glucose levels as well as 6-hr
fasting blood glucose levels were measured on designated days.  Specifically, 6-hr fasting blood glucose levels were measured on day -3 (before treatment), and days 7 and 14 (1 hr after acarbose and the 2.sup.nd dosing of VPM or R-VPM), respectively. 
Blood glucose from non-fasting animals were measured on day 0 (before treatment), and days 10 and 17 (1 hr after acarbose and the 2.sup.nd dosing of VPM or R-VPM).  In addition, blood HbA1c was measured on day -3 and day 17.  Body weight of each test
animal was also measured during the study period.
<BR><BR> Statistics
<BR><BR> Results were expressed as the mean.+-.standard error of the mean (SEM).  Unpaired student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test was used for statistical comparisons between substance-treated and vehicle-treated groups. 
Differences are considered significant at P&lt;0.05.
<BR><BR>Example 1 Combined Treatment of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl and Acarbose Reduced Blood Glucose Level in NIDDM Mice
<BR><BR> In this example, the combined effects of acarbose and (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM) or racemic verapamil (VPM) on non-fasting and 6-hr fasting blood glucose were evaluated in NIDDM mice.  Results are provided in FIGS. 1 and 2.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 1, which depicts the non-fasting blood glucose levels of NIDDM mice on days 0, 10, and 17 treated with acarbose (20 or 40 mg/Kg, qd) alone, or in combination with (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM, 30 mg/kg, bid) or racemic
verapamil (VPM, 30 mg/Kg, bid).  It was found that acarbose (20 or 40 mg/Kg, qd) alone only slightly reduced blood glucose levels on days 10 and 17; however, when the test animals were given both acarbose (40 mg/Kg, qd) and (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (R-VPM,
30 mg/kg, bid), their non-fasting blood glucose levels were further reduced, as compared to those receiving acarbose alone.  In addition, combined use of racemic verapamil and acarbose was ineffective in reducing the blood glucose level of NIDDM mice.
<BR><BR> Similar effects of acarbose and/or its combination with (R)-(+)-verapamil were also found on the 6-hrs fasting blood glucose levels.  As depicted in FIG. 2, the combined use of acarbose (40 mg/Kg, qd) and (R)-(+)-verapamil (30 mg/Kg, bid)
effectively reduced the 6-hrs fasting blood glucose levels of NIDDM mice on day 14, while the combined use of acarbose (40 mg/Kg, qd) and racemic verapamil resulted in even worst effect on the 6-hrs fasting blood glucose level, instead of a reduction,
the 6-hrs fasting blood glucose level was increased, as compared to that of the vehicle control.
<BR><BR> Another common indicator, glycated haemolglobin (HbA1c), which reflects average blood glucose levels over a duration was also measured in the present study.  HbA1c develops when haemolglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen
throughout the body joins with glucose in the blood and becomes "glycated." Since red blood cells in a human body survive for about 8-12 weeks before renewal, thus, the level of HbA1c gives an overall picture of average blood sugar levels over such
period.  It was found that oral administrations of acarbose alone (20 or 40 mg/Kg) and/or its combination with (R)-(+)-verapamil or racemic verapamil for 17 consecutive days had minimum or no effect on HbA1c level, as compared with that of the control
animals (data not shown).
<BR><BR> Taken together the findings in the working examples, acarbose alone (20 or 40 mg/Kg, qd) may only slightly reduce non-fasting blood glucose level, however, the combined use of acarbose (40 mg/Kg, qd) and (R)-(+)-verapamil (30 mg/Kg, bid)
produces significant reduction in non-fasting blood glucose level, as well as in the level of 6-hrs fasting blood glucose level.  Accordingly, acarbose and (R)-(+)-verapamil may be suitable for use as a medicament for treating diabetes mellitus and/or
disorders related thereto.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that the above description of embodiments is given by way of example only and that various modifications may be made by those with ordinary skill in the art.  The above specification, examples, and data provide a complete
description of the structure and use of exemplary embodiments of the invention.  Although various embodiments of the invention have been described above with a certain degree of particularity, or with reference to one or more individual embodiments,
those with ordinary skill in the art could make numerous alterations to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.
