       <p>The disclosure demonstrates the inhibition of replication of human
     cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in cultured human embryo skin muscle cells by two
     separate subclasses of direct-acting smooth muscle relaxing agents alone
     or in combination with each other. These two subclasses are characterized
     mechanistically as calcium influx blockers (or calcium channel blockers)
     and cyclic nucleotide modulators. More specifically, the class of calcium
     influx blockers is exemplified by the drugs <B><I>verapamil</I></B> (and
     methoxyverapamil), nifedipine (the prototype drug of 1,4
     dihydropyridines), and diltiazem. The class of cyclic nucleotide
     modulators is exemplified by the drugs isobutylmethylxanthine, papaverine
     (and its synthetic analog dioxyline), forskolin, and sodium nitroprusside.
     In addition, the present disclosure demonstrates that agents from one
     class, e.g., a calcium influx blocker, act synergistically when used in
     combination with agents from the other class, e.g., cyclic nucleotide
     modulators. The calcium influx blockers are shown to act synergistically

infections.  More specifically, the invention is directed towards the treatment of viral infections through the use of smooth muscle relaxing agents and agents that block the entry of calcium ions (Ca.sup.++) into cells.  These agents appear to act by
blocking replication of the target viruses in infected cells.
<BR><BR>Advances in the treatment of viral infections have been very slow in coming.  Very few efficacious antiviral agents presently exist.  A few agents have been touted for their potentially specific antiviral activity are in the research and
development stage.  The clinical efficacy of these agents, such as interferon and interferon inducers (e.g., polyanionic pyran copolymers and double stranded RNA) have yet to be reproducibly demonstrated.
<BR><BR>A few pharmaceutical agents have shown promise in the treatment of isolated viral infections, including the use of amantadine in the treatment of Influenze A.sub.2 strains.  The use of the antimetabolities, Idoxuridine and Cytarabine, in
antiviral therapy is hampered by a narrow spectrum of activity and potentially severe side effects.  Methisazone is receiving some support for its use against some pox and vaccinia strains.  Its use in pox infections is generally limited to prophylaxis. 
In general, there are presently no efficacious antiviral agents that demonstrate a broad spectrum of activity.  It now appears that no single broad spectrum agent, or family of agents, may be identified as useful in antiviral treatment.  Therefore,
research is being directed towards identifying antiviral agents with activity against selected viral diseases.
<BR><BR>A novel approach to the treatment of certain viral diseases, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus, is addressed by the present invention.  This approach involves the restriction of viral
expression and replication in infected cells by controlling and modifying the cellular responses to viral infection.
<BR><BR>HCMV causes acute and apparently life-long persistent infections of man (T. H. Weller, N. Eng.  J. Med.  285: 203-214, 267-274 (1971)).  HCMV infection has been determined the causative agent in a number of birth defects, including
microencephalopathy, hydroencephelopathy and microthalmia.  Other defects associated with pre-natal HCMV infections include severe mental retardation, disordered hepatic function, and hyperbilirubinemia.  Although the disease is often asymptomatic in
children and adults, HCMV infections in these groups have been shown to result in enlargement of the liver and spleen and deranged erythropoesis.  The disease may remain dormant for years, then reactivated by unknown causes.  Localized and generalized
HCMV infections have been shown to develop after immuno-suppressive and anti-neoplastic therapy.  HCMV is a member of the herpes family of viruses.
<BR><BR>The most widely recognized feature of HCMV-induced cytopathology is the formation of distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (CI's) (T. Albrecht, T. Cavello, N. L. Cole, and K. Graves, Lab. Invest., 42: 1-7 (1980)).  Another HCMV cytopathic
effect involves the rounding of fibroblastic cells beginning within the first several hours after infection.  By 12-24 hours post-infection, depending on the intensity of the infection, nearly all cells are small and rounded.
<BR><BR>The novel approach to restrict virus expression and replication presented by the present invention is to control the cellular response to virus infection.  Such approaches may be particularly warranted for human cytomegalovirus since this virus
is an important cause of disease for which effective therapeutic agents have not yet been identified.  Additionally, as previously noted, HCMV infections present notable changes in cytopathology which suggest that cytopathic-directed therapy might prove
particularly efficacious in the treatment of that disease.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A method is provided for the treatment of human viral diseases, in particular HCMV and HSV, through the use of drugs heretofore unknown to possess antiviral activity.  These agents can be classified in a broad sense as direct-acting smooth muscle
relaxing agents.  Two sub-classes of the direct-acting smooth muscle relaxing agents, the calcium influx blockers and cyclic nucleotide modulators, are shown to have antiviral activity.
<BR><BR>In particular, a method for treating viral infections in an infected host is presented wherein the method includes administering to the host an effective amount of a calcium influx blocker in combination with an effective amount of a cyclic
nucleotide modulator.  Calcium influx blockers are generally represented by the 1,4 dihydropyridines, the verapanoids and diltiazem.  The cyclic nucleotide modulators are generally represented by the agents, isobutylmethylxanthine, papaverine, dioxyline,
sodium nitroprusside, and forskolin.  These agents were chosen as representative agents for their particular chemical structural class.  For example, sodium nitroprusside is representative of those smooth muscle relaxing agents known as the nitrates. 
Similarly, the verapanoids are represented by, for example, verapamil and methoxyverapamil.  Similarly, the drug nifedipine is representative of the class of 1,4 dihydropyridines.
<BR><BR>In a further aspect of the present invention, a method for treating viral infections in an infected host is disclosed which includes administering to the host an effective amount of alpha interferon in combination with an effective amount of a
calcium influx blocker.  This combination also demonstrates synergistic antiviral activity over and above either one of these agents antiviral activity when used alone.
<BR><BR>The antiviral methods of the present invention may conveniently be performed utilizing a pharmaceutical composition which comprises an effective amount of a calcium influx blocker, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination
with an effective amount of a cyclic nucleotide modulator, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  Such compositions may further include the addition of an effective amount of alpha interferon.  Interferon-containing compositions, however, may
simply include the alpha interferon in combination with an effective amount of a calcium influx blocker.
<BR><BR>In still further aspects of the present invention, a method for treating viral infections in an infected host is disclosed which includes administering to the host an effective amount of a synthetic nucleoside analog, for example, DHPG
(9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, together with an effective amount of a papaverine family agent having an available isoquinoline ring nitrogen (e.g.--papaverine, dioxyline, ethaverine or
tetrahydropapaverine), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.  This combination, particularly where papaverine is the selected papaverine family agent, demonstrates surprising synergistic antiviral activity over and above either one of these
agent's antiviral activity when used alone.
<BR><BR>Moreover, studies are disclosed which suggest that papaverine, one of the cyclic nucleotide modulations, is acting mechanistically as an antiviral agent through inhibiting the release of intracellular free calcium from intracellular calcium
stores.  The demonstrated ability of papaverine to inhibit intracellular calcium release further suggests that this agent, acting alone or in combination with other agents, may have practical value in the control of virus infections, immune responses,
and cell proliferation such as occurs in cancer.  Cytosolic Ca.sup.++ responses are important in the activation of immune cells, the control of initiation of proliferation of other cells including cancer cells, and the replication of viruses.  Therefore,
papaverine, and related drugs, through its inhibition of the Ca.sup.++ response which is associated with immune cell activation, cancer, and other cell proliferation and virus replication may have therapeutic value where these activities are involved.

<BR><BR>In its most general and overall scope, the present invention embodies the realization that viral infections may be successfully treated through the inhibition of cellular calcium fluxes.  The antiviral agents of the present invention appear to
act through calcium flux inhibition which, in turn, serves to block viral replication.  This viral replication can most readily be visualized in the case of HCMV infections where viral infection is accompanied by a characteristic, readily observable,
morphologic cascade.  The sequence of the cellular responses exhibited upon HCMV infection is rounding, "contraction," "relaxation," and enlargement.  Rounding of cells begins before 5 hours post-infection (PI) when cells in intermediate stages of
rounding are observed, and continues through 12 to 24 hours PI.  At this time the population of those rounded cells with the smallest size is similar in diameter to that of the nucleus of uninfected cells.  By 48 hours PI most infected cells have
"relaxed," partially flattened, and begun to enlarge.  At later times, HCMV-infected cells are observed to be much enlarged.  Inhibition of early cellular responses to HCMV infection is achieved by Ca.sup.++ influx blockers and other smooth muscle
relaxing agents.
<BR><BR>The present invention utilizes drugs which inhibit the observed morphologic cascade which cells undergo during HCMV infection.  The initial response of the cells to HCMV infection, cell rounding, is mediated by the activation of contractile
elements within the cell.  Likewise, cellular control of these contractile elements is mediated by changes in the intracellular concentration of calcium ions.  More specifically, numerous cellular responses to ear;y viral infection are consistent with a
rise in intracellular free Ca.sup.++.  Thus, these morphologic responses could be related to a change in plasma membrane permeability and a concomitant Ca.sup.++ influx.
<BR><BR>Thus, in certain aspects, the present invention embodies the realization that viral infections may be treated by correcting for symptomatic changes in cellular morphology.  The successful use of smooth muscle-relaxing agents in reversing the cell
rounding induced by HCMV is demonstrated by direct microscopic examination of infected cells after drug treatment.  A concomitant inhibition of viral replication is demonstrated by fold reductions in viral plaque forming units being released from treated
cells.
<BR><BR>The antiviral agents of the present invention appear to act by either inhibiting the influx of extracellular calcium into infected cells (i.e., the calcium influx blockers) or by inhibiting the flux of calcium intracellularly from intracellular
calcium "pools".  In CMV infected cells, calcium flux inhibition of either variety results in the observed return to morphologic normally.  In treating viral infections which do not effect similar cellular morphologic changes, (for example, as in
measles, influenza and HTLV III (AIDS) infections) there, of course, is no readily observable morphologic reversion as in the case of CMV.  However, the fact that the present agents are active in either case suggests the possibility that calcium
sensitive antiviral targets may exist in addition to, or in combination with calcium sensitive morphologic structures.
<BR><BR>Smooth muscle relaxing agents exert their activity by both indirect (e.g., through modification of smooth muscle nerve transmissions) and direct (i.e., through direct action on the cells) actions.  The indirect-acting smooth muscle relaxing
agents are represented by a wide variety of agents exhibiting great variations in mechanisms of action.  These indirect-acting smooth muscle relaxing agents have not been tested for activity in inhibiting virus replication in infected cells.
<BR><BR>Two classes of direct-acting agents, the calcium influx blockers (also referred to as calcium channel blockers) and cyclic nucleotide modulators, as a group demonstrate very high inhibition of viral replication in infected cells.
<BR><BR>The calcium influx blockers are represented by three general chemical classes of agents: (1) the 1,4 dihydropyridines (of which the prototype drug is nifedipine), (2) a second class, the verapanoids, which includes verapamil and methoxyverapamil,
and (3) a third class characterized by the drug diltiazem.
<BR><BR>The smooth muscle relaxing agents that exert their action via modulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels are generally classified as to whether or not they affect the enzyme, phosphodiesterase.  Phosphodiesterase is the enzyme
responsible for metabolism of cyclic nucleotides.  The most effective cyclic nucleotide modulators, in terms of inhibiting viral replication, are represented by the agents papaverine, and dioxyline, a synthetic compound that is both chemically and
pharmacologically very similar to paparevine.  The second class of smooth muscle relaxing cyclic nucleotide modulators exert their activity through poorly understood mechanisms other than through inhibition of phosphodiesterase.  This class includes the
agents forskolin and sodium nitroprusside.
<BR><BR>However, further evidence suggests that papaverine may alternatively or additionally be acting by a second mechanism other than cyclic nucleotide modulation.  This second mechanism is by inhibition of intracellular calcium fluxes, i.e., by
inhibiting the release of intracellular free calcium from intracellular calcium stores.  In particular, it is shown that effective antiviral treatment may be obtained with papaverine at concentrations that do not result in the inhibition of
phosphodiesterase activity, i.e., at papaverine concentrations that do not affect intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels.
<BR><BR>Treatment of virtually infected cells with a combination of smooth muscle relaxing agents in accordance with the present invention can provide a greatly enhanced antiviral efficacy when compared to treatment with individual agents.  In
particular, treatments with a combination of a cyclic nucleotide modulator (e.g., papaverine) with a calcium influx blocker (e.g., verapamil or nifedipine) demonstrate surprising synergistic effects.  Administered alone, verapamil (30 uM) resulted in a
10-fold inhibition and papaverine (5 uM) resulted in an 18-fold viral inhibition.  However, when administered in combination at the same concentrations, these agents provided a 112-fold inhibition of viral yields.  For the purposes of the present
invention, it was felt that the best evidence available to demonstrate these agents activity in humans was by demonstrating their ability to inhibit viral replication and production in infected human cells in culture.
<BR><BR>Moreover, treatment of virtually infected cells with papaverine in combination with DHPG (dihydroxy propoxymethyl guanine), a synthetic nucleoside analog, has been shown to demonstrate surprising synergistic antiviral efficacy.  For example, when
administrated alone to CMV infected cells, papaverine, at 1.5 uM, resulted in approximately an 8.7-fold inhibition of virus yields over controls.  DHPG, when administered alone to similarly infected cells at a concentration of 3 uM, resulted in
approximately a 72-fold inhibition of viral yields.  However, when administered in combination at these same concentrations, these agents provided a 3000-fold inhibition over controls.
<BR><BR>Although it is contemplated that the present invention may be successfully utilized to treat numerous types of viral infections, including those caused by the RNA and DNA viruses, the invention is herein disclosed in terms of its particular
efficacy in inhibiting CMV and herpes virus infections, both HSV-1 and HSV-2.  These viral infections, in addition to presenting a formidable health problem for which few efficacious agents are present available, present a useful model system for
identifying those agents which exert their antiviral activity through modulation of calcium levels.  Thus, the morphologic changes associated with CMV infection of cells, and the resultant morphology which accompanies CMV inhibition, provides a useful,
readily observable indicator of antiviral activity.  However, the efficacy of the present agents in treating viral infections which do not exhibit a similarly striking morphologic cascade, e.g., the measles, influenza and HCMV III viruses, suggests that
the morphologic effects observed in the treatment of CMV-infected cells may be secondary to, or in addition to, the underlying antiviral mechanism.
<BR><BR>In a typical protocol, human embryo skin muscle cells are first grown to confluency in Leighton tubes in 1 ml.  of Eagle's media supplemented with Earle's salts, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and 0.75% sodium bicarbonate.  This requires
approximately 2-4 days growth.  At the end of this time, the tubes contain about 2.times.10.sup.5 cells.  Once confluent, the growth media is removed and 0.3 ml.  of the virus stock is placed onto the cells (5 pfu/cell) and allowed to adsorb for 1 hr. 
at 37.degree.  C. The virus stock is aspirated off and the cell monolayer washed twice with maintenance media (Eagle's MEM supplemented with Earle's salts, 5% FCS, and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate).  The last wash is replaced with 1 ml.  of fresh maintenance
media containing the indicated drug concentration.  The drug is always made up fresh.
<BR><BR>The cells are generally treated with drug for a total of 120 hours.  In some experiments, the drug-containing media is replaced every 24 hrs., and in others, every 48 hrs.  This variation has no effect on the results.
<BR><BR>To test the level of virus replication during drug treatment, the treated cells are quick-frozen in a Revco -70.degree.  C. freezer, then put through two freeze/thaw cycles.  The cell-containing tubes are then sonicated in a "bath" sonicator for
45 seconds.  The cell lysates are assayed for infecticity by a standard plaque assya.  (Albrecht, T. and Weller, T. H., Am.  J. Clin. Path., 73: 648-651 (1980)).  The following table (Table 1) depicts the results of initial experiments which demonstrated
activity of the smooth muscle relaxing agents in inhibiting HCMV replication using the foregoing protocol.

<BR><BR>Further tests of the smooth muscle relaxing agents against two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2) demonstrate the usefulness of the present invention in inhibiting the replication of herpes virus.  The particular strain of HSV-1
utilized was KOS and HSV-2 was 198.  The activity of the agents against HSV was determined in the same manner as described above for CMV.  Both of the viral strains were grown in human embryo skin muscle cells in culture and the infected cells were then
transferred to mecia containing 30 ug/ml of the indicated agent and the PFU determined at 24 hours PI.  These results are compiled in the following table (Table 2).

<BR><BR>The discussion and experimental examples which follow, provide a more in-depth disclosure of the present invention and is meant to provide those of skill in the art with a greater understanding and appreciation of the mechanistic antiviral
function of the agents presently disclosed.
<BR><BR>A. Inhibition of the cellular response to cytomegalovirus infection
<BR><BR>1.  Sequence of cellular responses to CMV infection
<BR><BR>Following human embryonic fibroblasts infection with CNV and other viruses, the infected cells demonstrate a progression of cytopathic effects (Albrecht et al., 1983), beginning with rounding of the cells by 5 hours post-infection (PI).  In the
course of rounding, the cells assume an intermediate form, which raised the possibility that these cells might be undergoing a contractile-like response.  This concept was supported by the finding that the rounded cells decreased in diameter until at 24
h PI the cells with the smallest size were approximately the size of the nucleus of uninfected cells.  By 48 h PI, the cells "relax," flatten, and enlarge.  During the next several days, the cells progressively enlarge and develop the nuclear and
cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of viral infection.
<BR><BR>2.  "Relaxation" and cytomegaly do not require CMV DNA synthesis
<BR><BR>In cytomegalovirus infected cells, DNA synthesis begins between 12 and 16 h PI.  Thus, rounding and "contraction" of CMV-infected cells (beginning before 5 h PI) are, by definition, early events in the virus replication cycle, since they occur
before the onset of virus DNA synthesis; "relaxation" and enlargement are presumably "late" events, since they occur only after the time of onset of virus DNA synthesis.  To determine if "relaxation" and enlargement required CMV DNA synthesis, SM cells
were infected and then treated with 30 ug/ml of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) which blocks virus DNA synthesis.  Ara-C failed to block either "relaxation" or enlargement.  These data indicate that cytomegaly, although a late event, does not require virus
DNA synthesis and is the result of early CMV gene expression.
<BR><BR>3.  The effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers on the development and progression of cytomegaly and nuclear inclusions
<BR><BR>The previous study demonstrated that late cellular responses to CMV infection such as "relaxation" and cytomegaly, did not require late CMV gene expression.  Since early cellular responses such as rounding and "contraction" are inhibited by
Ca.sup.++ influx blockers (e.g., verapamil, nifedipine), it was possible that late responses would also be inhibited by these drugs.  Treatment of CMV-infected cells with either verapamil or nifedipine at 5 h PI inhibited late cellular responses.  In
verapamil-treated cells, NIs were present in most nuclei, although their size was reduced relative to untreated controls.  These data indicate that the development and progression of CMV NIs are dependent on a Ca.sup.++ influx as are other cellular
responses to CMV infection.
<BR><BR>4.  The effect of cyclic nucleotide modulators on the development and progression of CMV-induced late cellular responses
<BR><BR>The effect of cyclic nucleotide modulators on the development and progression of cytomegaly and NIs was measured by microscopic examination of CMV-infected, H&E-stained SM (hyman embryo skin muscle cells) or THY cells.  The cyclic nucleotide
modulating drugs were added at 5 h PI which permitted early CMV-induced cellular responses such as cell rounding and "contraction" to occur.  As displayed in Table 3, cyclic nucleotide modulating drugs added at 5 h PI inhibited "relaxation," development
of cytomegaly, and the formation and progression of NIs measured at 48 and 72 h PI.  These drugs, which are well recognized for increasing the concentration of cAMP and/or cGMP in other tissues, were potent inhibitors of late cellular responses to CMV
infection.

<BR><BR>B. C.sup.++ responses to CMV infection
<BR><BR>1.  The effect of CMV on Ca.sup.++ fluxes in human fibroblasts
<BR><BR>Measurement of .sup.45 Ca.sup.++ in infected and mock-infected cells following a 30 min. incubation period in media containing .sup.45 CaCl.sub.2 (1 uCi/ml), suggested that intracelluar [Ca.sup.++ ] increases in CMV-invected cells by 1 h
post-infection (FIG. 1).  This Ca.sup.++ influx declined by 3 h PI.  Significant differences in .sup.45 Ca.sup.++ influx were not noted between the virus-infection and the control cells from 12 to 24 h PI.  This influx was significantly inhibited in the
presence of 30 ug/ml of verapamil.  Although these results were reproducible, the experimental data were dependent on several variables.  As the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was deceased, the time at which the maximum .sup.45 Ca.sup.++ influx occurred
was delayed and the amount of radioactivity was decreased.  For example, at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell, the maximum influx was observed at 8 h PI.  If the control cells were stimulated at 0 h by replacing the cell lysate with fresh rather than spent
medium, then a .sup.45 Ca.sup.++ influx was also observed in the control cells.  Although the influx obtained under these altered conditions occurred at the same time in infected and control cells, the magnitude of the influx in infected cells was about
2-fold greater.
<BR><BR>2.  Sequestering of Ca.sup.++ in CMV-infected cells
<BR><BR>The ability of CMV to increase the amount of Ca.sup.++ sequestered in TCA-precipitable macromolecules was examined over a similar time interval.  A rapid and substantial increase in .sup.45 Ca.sup.++ radioactivity associated with the
TCA-precipitable fraction of infected cells was observed (FIG. 2).  These data indicate that CMV is able to increase total cellular and bound cellular Ca.sup.++ early after infection.
<BR><BR>3.  Effect of CMV on intracellular free (IF) [Ca.sup.++ ]
<BR><BR>Since many cellular mechanisms are regulated by changes in the intracellular levels of "free" calcium (IF [Ca.sup.++ ]), the IF [Ca.sup.++ in infected and uninfected cells were measured using the fluroescent Ca.sup.++ indicator, Quin-2.  Quin-2
fluorescence increased by about 100% as early as 12 h PI, indicating a large increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ]. This rise continued and then leveled off by 24 h PI (FIG. 3) at which time the fluorescence of infected cells was approximately 3 times more than in
uninfected cells.
<BR><BR>4.  Relationship of CMV gene dosage to IF [Ca.sup.++]
<BR><BR>To determine the effect of CMV gene dosage on the CMV-induced increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ], cells were infected with different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (10, 3.5 and 1 PFU/cell).  The increase in fluorescence units (FU) in infected cells
relative to the control cells by 24 h PI was 67.5, 45.8 and 20.7 percent, respectively (Table 4).  As the FU are proportional to the IF [Ca.sup.++ ], these results indicate that the increase in the CMV-induced IF [Ca.sup.++ ] is dependent on the virus
gene dosage.

<BR><BR>5.  Effect of metabolic inhibitors and CMV-inactivation on the CMV-induced IF [Ca.sup.++ ] response
<BR><BR>It was additionally determined that active CMV was required for the observed increase in the IF [Ca.sup.++ ]. Thus, when CMV was inactivated by heat (56.degree.  for 1 h), preincubation with CMV-specific antisera (37.degree.  C. for 1 h), or
exposure to UV light (7.2.times.10.sup.4 ergs/mm.sup.2), the fluorescence was less than that obtained with control cells infected with untreated CMV stock.  Inhibition of the fluorescence increase by CMV inactivation was 96, 60 and 74 percent,
respectively, at 24 h PI (Table 5).  The inhibition of the fluorescence increase by CMV-inactivation indicates that the CMV-induced increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] is dependent upon a viable CMV genoma.  As shown in Table 5, cycloheximide (10 ug/ml)
inhibited the CMV-induced Quin-2 fluorescence increase by 84%.  Cordycepin (20 ug/ml), an inhibitor of mRNA polyadenylation, had a similar effect, inhibiting the increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] by 62%.  Thus, protein synthesis and competent mRNA were also
required for the induction of the increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ].

<BR><BR>6.  The phase of CMV expression responsible for induction of increased IF [Ca.sup.++ ].
<BR><BR>Experimental results suggested that the Ca.sup.++ influx occurred early in the replication cycle of CMV.  The increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] and the morphologic cellular response also appear to begin at early times.  To more precisely determine the
phase of CMV gene expression responsible for the IF [Ca.sup.++ ] response (increase), protein synthesis was blocked in infected cells with cycloheximide (CH) and then the cells were released from the translational block in the presence or absence of a
"transcription block" (3'-deoxyadenosine).  Data from representative experiments are summarized in Table 6.  At 24 h PI, about 54% more fluorescence was observed in infected than in noninfected cells.  Addition of CH from 0-6 h PI reduced the increase in
fluorescence to about 27%.  The presence of 3'-deoxyadenosine from 6 to 24 h PI did not appreciably affect the level of fluorescence beyond that expected were transcription of a gene begins in the immediate early phase and continues into the early phase,
suggesting that the increase in intracellular free Ca.sup.++ was the result of immediate early CMV gene expression.

<BR><BR>To more definitively determine the phase of CMV gene expression responsible for the increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] more stringent conditions were used.  Infected cells were treated with CH from -2 h PI through the time of virus absorption, and up to
2, 4, or 6 h PI.  Then the CH was washed out and the cells were maintained through 24 h PI in the presence or absence of 3'-deoxyadenosine.  Data summarized in Table 7 indicate that there was no significant difference between the Quin-2 fluorescence of
CMV-infected cells in the presence or absence of 3-deoxyadenosine, indicating that the CMV-induced rise in intracellular free [Ca.sup.++ is an immediate early function.

<BR><BR>7.  Conservation of the capacity to induce IF [Ca.sup.++ ] response among CMV strains
<BR><BR>The effect of CMV laboratory strains (AD169, Davis and C-87) on IF [Ca.sup.++ ] was compared.  The increases in fluroescence level obtained were similar among the three laboratory strains.  Increases in fluorescence from 82% to 150% were
observed.  These results indicate that the IF [Ca.sup.++ ] response is not unique to strain AD-169, and that the ability of CMV to induce an increase in IF [CA.sup.++ ] is conserved among other CMV strains.
<BR><BR>8.  Effect of C.sup.++ influx blockers on CMV-induced IF [Ca.sup.++ ]
<BR><BR>The sensitivity of the CMV-induced rise in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] to recognized Ca.sup.++ influx blockers (verapamil and nifedipine) was tested.  Additon to verapamil (60 ug/ml) or nifedipine (60 ug/ml) at 0 h PI inhibited the CMV-induced increase in
fluorescence when measured at 24 or 48 h PI.  While verapamil inhibited the percent change in fluorescence by 75% and 51% at 24 and 48 h PI, respectively; nifedipine inhibited the fluorescence increase by 89% and 28%, respectively.  Diltiazem (80 ug/ml),
another Ca.sup.++ influx blocker, inhibited the increase in IF [Ca.sup.++ ] by almost 100% by 24 h PI, while nifedipine inhibited the fluorescence by 112% with the same experimental conditions.
<BR><BR>9.  Effect of papaverine on CMV-induced IR [Ca.sup.++ ]
<BR><BR>Since CMV-induced cytopathology and CMV replication are Ca.sup.++ dependent, the effect of papaverine on the CMV-induced IF[Ca.sup.++ ] response was tested at various times PI.  Papaverine inhibited the CMV-induced enhancement of IF[Ca.sup.++ ]
as measured by Quin-2 fluorescence.  The percent inhibition of fluorescence response was 24% by five hours PI and was maximal by 48 h PI approaching 100%.  These data suggest the possibility that the effect of papaverine on CMV replication and
CMV-induced cytopathology is through control of the IF[Ca.sup.++ ] response.
<BR><BR>From the studies of the cytopathologic responses of cells to CMV infection, it was suggested that papaverine inhibited the development of NIs and cytomegaly.  To determine if papaverine treatment actually caused a decrease in intracellular free
[Ca.sup.++ ] in CMV-infected cells, the Quin-2 fluorescence in CMV-infected cells was measured in the presence or absence of 30 ug/ml of papaverine.  At this papaverine dose, the Quin-2 fluorescence was inhibited at 24 and 48 h PI by 95% and 103%,
respectively.  The results suggest that some of the effect of papaverine on the cellular response to CMV and on virus replication could be due to an inhibition of the IF [Ca.sup.++ ] response.
<BR><BR>10.  Similarities between the effect of the Ca.sup.++ ionophore A23187 and CMV on human fibroblasts
<BR><BR>Since the late cellular responses to CMV infection were found to be induced by a Ca.sup.++ influx, then it is possible that other agents such as calcium ionophores might induce similar responses in SM and THY cells.  Therefore, SM and THY cells
wee treated with the Ca.sup.++ ionophore A23187 (3.times.10.sup.-5 M).  Enlarged cells resulted after 5 min exposure to the ionophore.  The involvement of a Ca.sup.++ influx in cellular responses to CMV infection is thus consistent with this observation
and the previous observations of inhibition of the late cellular responses to CMV by Ca.sup.++ influx blockers and cyclic nucleotide modulators.
<BR><BR>C. Na.sup.+ responses to CMV infection
<BR><BR>1.  The effect of Na.sup.+ entry blockers on CMV-induced cytomegaly
<BR><BR>It was hypothesized that an increase in intracellular sodium levels [Na.sup.+ ] secondary to the CMV-induced Ca.sup.++ influx would likely be followed by entry of water into the cell leading to cell enlargement.  If this were the case, then
Na.sup.+ entry blockers such as amiloride would be expected to inhibit enlargement.  Indeed, if was found that when amiloride (300 uM) was added at 12 h PI, CMV-infected cells failed to enlarge to the same extent as untreated CMV-infected controls.  In
addition, nuclear inclusions were considerably decreased in size at 72 h PI.
<BR><BR>2.  The effect of CMV on the rate of .sup.86 Rb uptake via the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump
<BR><BR>Similarly, it was hypothesized that the CMV-induced Ca.sup.++ influx is associated with or followed by a Na.sup.+ influx that would bring about the entry of water into the cell leading to cell enlargement.  Since the cell volume is controlled by
the ouabain-sensitive Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump, the activity of the pump was measured by measuring the ouabain-sensitive .sup.86 Rb uptake in CMV-infected cells in the presence and absence of ouabain.  FIG. 4 shows the rate of .sup.86 Rb uptake during a 30
min interval in CMV-infected cells at 24 h PI.  This experiment shows that the rate of uptake over this period is linear.
<BR><BR>3.  The effect of CMV on the ouabain-sensitive Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ ATPase
<BR><BR>FIG. 5 demonstrates the effect of CMV on the activity of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ ATPase (pump).  There is an initial phase of inhibition in the activity of the pump which is maximal by 12 to 24 h PI, which is then followed by stimulation of the
activity of the pump that starts about 48 h PI and continues through 96 h PI.  The enhancement of the activity of the pump coincides with the phase of cell enlargement after CMV-infection suggesting that cytomegaly might be due to increased intracellular
Na.sup.+ levels.
<BR><BR>4.  The effect of amiloride on CMV-induced stimulation of ouabain-sensitive .sup.86 Rb uptake
<BR><BR>Since enhancement of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump activity is associated with increased intracellular Na.sup.+, the effect of amiloride, a Na.sup.+ entry blocker, was tested on the CMV-induced stimulation phase of the pump.  Amiloride (200 uM) was
added to CMV-infected cells at 24 h PI and the ouabain-sensitive .sup.86 Rb uptake was measured at 48 h PI.  The apparent stimulation of the CMV-induced .sup.86 Rb uptake was inhibited by more than 77.6% to level less than that observed in the control
uninfected cells during this 24 h period in the presence of amiloride.  These data indicate that the CMV-induced stimulation of the pump was Na.sup.+ dependent.
<BR><BR>5.  The effect of nifedipine on the ouabain-sensitive Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump
<BR><BR>To determine if the enhancement of the activity of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump in CMV-infected cells was Ca.sup.++ dependent, the effect of nifedipine on the ouabain-sensitive .sup.86 Rb uptake was measured.  Data indicated that nifedipine (30
ug/ml), when added at 0 h, inhibited the activity of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump in CMV-infected cells.  In the initial phase of CMV-induced inhibition, the activity of the pump was further depressed from -21% and -18% at 12 h PI to -67% and -83% relative
to the cell control, respectively.
<BR><BR>During the CMV-induced enhancement phase, the activity of the pump was inhibited from 37.5% and 37% at 48 and 72 h PI to -39% and -82% relative to the cell control, respectively.  These data suggest that the effect of CMV on the activity of the
Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump may be regulated by the intracellular Ca.sup.++ levels.
<BR><BR>6.  The effect of Ca.sup.++ ionophores on the activity of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump
<BR><BR>Since CMV has an initial phase of inhibition of the Na.sup.+ /K.sup.+ pump, it was determined whether this effect was possibly Ca.sup.++ mediated.  In this experiment, two Ca.sup.++ ionophores were used to test their effect on the
ouabain-sensitive .sup.86 Rb uptake in the uninfected cells.  Table 8 shows that both Ca.sup.++ ionophores (A21387, Ionomycin) at a concentration of 1.times.10.sup.-5 M were able to inhibit the ouabain-sensitive counts by 50%.

<BR><BR>D. Inhibition of CMV and herpes simplex virus replication
<BR><BR>1.  By Ca.sup.++ -influx blockers
<BR><BR>Ca.sup.++ influx blockers have been divided into 3 classes based on differing tissue specificities.  Verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem are the most extensively studied prototypes of the three classes of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers.  FIG. 6
summarizes the results obtained when the effect of a representative of each of the three classes of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers was studied on the replication of CMV in SM cells.  Nifedipine was the most effective of the three Ca.sup.++ -influx blocking
drugs, while diltiazem was not effective in inhibiting CMV yields.  Inhibition of CMV yields was greater than 95% at a concentration with 10.sup.-4 M of either nifedipine or verapamil.  Approximately 2.times.10.sup.-5 M nifedipine or verapamil was needed
to obtain 50% inhibition of CMV yield.
<BR><BR>HSV-1 replication was somewhat less sensitive to the antiviral effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers than CMV replication (FIG. 7).  A dose of 10.sup.-4 verapamil inhibited HSV-1 yields by 90%.  The same dose of nifedipine resulted in 77.2%
inhibition of the HSV-1 yield.  Examination of FIG. 7 indicates that 50% inhibition of HSV-1 yields was obtained with a dose of approximately 3.times.10.sup.-5 M (1.7.times.10.sup.-5 g/ml) nifedipine or 1.6.times.10.sup.-5 M (7.8.times.10-6 g/ml)
verapamil.  A concentration greater than 10.sup.-4 M (4.5.times.10.sup.-5 g/ml) of diltiazem was required to obtain 50% inhibition of HSV-1 yields.
<BR><BR>As a first step in increasing our understanding of the mechanism of antiviral activity of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers, a kinetic study was done in cells infected with HSV-1 and treated with verapamil.  Confluent SM cells were pretreated with 30
ug/ml of verapamil at various times before virus infection.  Virus yields were measured at 33 h PI.  Results are shown in Table 9.  Pretreatment of cells with verapamil at 24, 12 or 2 h before virus infection resulted in no significant inhibition of
HSV-1 yields (7-40%).  Pretreatment of cells with verapamil and posttreatment after virus infection resulted in levels of inhibition of HSV-1 yields similar to post-treatment with verapamil alone.  Enhanced inhibition was not observed following
pretreatment.  These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of verapamil against HSV-1 replication begins only after virus infection of cells.  Establishment of an antiviral state as observed with interferon treatment seems to be unlikely with verapamil
and efficient replication of HSV-1 apparently requires a Ca.sup.++ influx.

<BR><BR>2.  The effect of increased extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ] on the antiviral effects of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers
<BR><BR>HSV-1 and CMV replication are sensitive to the effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers.  In other words, the replication of HSV-1 and CMV may induce the rapid influx of Ca.sup.++ into the cell from the extracellular medium.  Based on this
observation, it was reasoned that the antiviral effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers would be decreased by increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca.sup.++.  This possibility was tested using Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) with varying
concentrations of Ca.sup.++ as CaCl.sub.2, 1.8 mM, 3.6 mM, and 7.2 mM.  Four drugs from three classes of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers were tested in the presence of increased extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ]. Verapamil (30 ug/ml) inhibited HSV-1 yields by 99%. 
The inhibitory effect of verapamil was decreased by increasing extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ]. More than a 2-fold increase in HSV-1 yield was observed with 3.6 mM Ca.sup.+ + and almost 4.8-fold more virus was obtained with 7.2 mM Ca.sup.++.  The results with
nifedipine were similar.  38% and 46% greater virus yields with increasing extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ] of 3.6 and 7.2 mM, respectively.  The antiviral effect of gallopamil, a derivative of verapamil, was also decreased with 3.6 mM or 7.2 mM Ca.sup.++. 
Virus yields were increased by 82% in 3.6 mM or 7.23 mM Ca.sup.++.  Virus yields were increased by 82% in 3.6 mM Ca.sup.++ and by 50% in 7.2 mM Ca.sup.++.  The yields of HSV from cells treated with diltiazem were not greatly affected by altering the
extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ] concentration.  Less than a 10% increase in virus yield was observed in the presence of diltiazem with 3.6 mM or 7.2 mM Ca.sup.++.  These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers is
related to their ability to block the influx of extracellular Ca.sup.++.
<BR><BR>In addition to the recognized Ca.sup.++ influx blockers, one cyclic nucleotide modulator was tested.  Since papaverine has been postulated also to affect Ca.sup.++ fluxes, the effect of increased extracellular [Ca.sup.++ ] on papaverine
inhibition of HSV yields was examined.  Papaverine (30 ug/ml) inhibited HSV-1 yield by about 85% in the presence of 1.8 mM Ca.sup.++.  By increasing the extracellular calcium concentration, HSV-1 yields were increased by 101% (3.6 mM Ca.sup.++) or 136%
(7.2 mM Ca.sup.++).
<BR><BR>3.  By cyclic nucleotide modulators
<BR><BR>The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP have been shown to act as secondary and/or synarchic messengers and to affect Ca.sup.++ -mediated events.  Thus, the effects of several drugs that increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP or cGMP or both
were tested for antiviral activity.  FIGS. 8 and 9 summarize the results of experiments with HSV-1- and CMV-infected cells.  Papaverine increases the intracellular levels of both cyclic nucleotides by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase activities. 
Papaverine inhibited HSV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 8).  A dose of 30 ug/ml of papaverine inhibited HSV-1 replication by about 90%.  A dose of 10 ug/ml of papaverine resulted in 70% inhibition while a dose of 3 ug/ml of papaverine
exerted less than a 50% inhibition of HSV yields.  Nitroprusside increases the intracellular level of cGMP, but not of cAMP.  Nitroprusside treatment was not as effective as papaverine.  Forskolin, which increases the level of cAMP, did not have an
inhibitory effect on HSV-1 replication.  These results, when considered together with those for papaverine and nitroprusside, suggest that the increase of both cyclic nucleotides may effect the replication of HSV-1, but that increases in the level of
either cGMP or cAMP alone may not be as important as direct effects on Ca.sup.++ influx or the coordinate increases of both cyclic nucleotides.
<BR><BR>While cyclic nucleotide modulators gave no better inhibition of HSV-1 replication than Ca.sup.++ influx blockers, papaverine showed a dramatic inhibition if CMV replication (FIG. 9).  More than 99.9999% (10.sup.6 -fold) inhibition of CMV yield
was observed with 10.sup.-4 M (3.4.times.10.sup.-5 g/ml) papaverine.  99% (100-fold) inhibition of CMV yield was obtained at less than 10.sup.-5 M of papaverine.  Sodium nitroprusside at 10.sup.-4 M (2.6.times.10.sup.-5 g/ml) resulted in about 99%
inhibition of CMV yield.  Forskolin, as in the case of HSV-1 infection, was not effective against CMV infection.  The drop in virus yield at a concentration of 10.sup.-4 M forskolin might be due to the toxicity of forskolin at the time of this particular
experiment, but was not a consistent finding.  A comparison of data from FIGS. 8 and 9 suggest that CMV replication is more sensitive than HSV-1 replication to the increase of both cyclic nucleotides or cGMP alone.
<BR><BR>4.  Comparison of the anti-CMV effect of two papaverine preparations
<BR><BR>To ensure that the effect of papaverine (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was due to papaverine and not due to other elements in papaverine preparations as supplied by Lilly for injection, the anti-CMV effect of two papaverine preparations
(papaverine in solution from Eli Lilly, papaverine in solid form from Sigma) was compared.  Both preparations of papaverine were found to be similarly effective against CMV replication.  Apparently the antiviral effect of Lilly's papaverine preparation
is due to papaverine.
<BR><BR>5.  The antiviral effect of combination treatment with papaverine and Ca.sup.++ influx blockers
<BR><BR>Combination antimicrobial therapy has proved to be effective in curing several bacterial diseases.  Moreover, combination treatment permits the reduction of the dosage of antibiotics to lessen toxicity and to prevent the appearance of
antibiotic-resistant strains.  With these advantages in mind, combination treatment with papaverine and Ca.sup.++ influx blockers was tried.  Suboptimal doses of each drug were used.  The results (Table 10) suggest the possibility of synergistic effects
with combination treatment of a cyclic nucleotide modulator (e.g.,-- papaverine) and a calcium influx blocker (e.g.--verapamil or nifedipine).  Verapamil (30 u M ) resulted in a 10-fold inhibition and papaverine (5 u M) resulted in 18-fold inhibition of
CMV yields.  When both verapamil (30 u M) and papaverine (5 u M) were used in combination, 112-fold inhibition of CMV yields was obtained.  A somewhat greater synergistic effect was observed with the combination of 30 u M nifedipine and 5 u M papaverine. Diltiazem, however, did not demonstrate synergistic effects when used in combination with papaverine.  In fact, less inhibitory effect was evident with combination treatment with diltiazem and papaverine than papaverine alone.  These results, in part,
correlate with the observation that verapamil and nifedipine were more effective in inhibiting CMV replication than diltiazem.

infected cultures to 30 uM in the  presence or absence of 5 uM papaverine. Media were changed at 48 h with  fresh drugs. Virus yields were determined at 96 h PI.
<BR><BR>7.  The relationship between the time of removal of papaverine and inhibition of CMV yields
<BR><BR>As shown in Table 11, the antiviral action of papaverine is readily reversible through at least 6 h PI.  The drug is apparently effectively washed out since yields from cells washed at 4 and 6 h were enhanced over untreated controls.  Even when
the drug was washed out at later times through 72 h PI, yields from 37% to 14% of the control were obtained.  Thus, the inhibitory effect of papaverine is reversible.  The diminishing yields obtained following reversal of the papaverine block suggest
that at later times the inhibitory action of papaverine may not be reversible even though the drug has been effectively removed.  This possibility will be tested in future studies.  Furthermore, it is not clear from this experiment what is the fate of
the papaverine-treated, CMV-infected cell.  This question will also be answered in future studies.

<BR><BR>E. Stage od CMV replication sensitive to the antiviral effects of papaverine
<BR><BR>1.  Time of addition studies
<BR><BR>As papaverine was highly effective in inhibiting CMV replication, the time point at which the replication of CMV is sensitive to treatment with papaverine was determined.  Cells were infected with CMV and treated with 10 ug/ml of papaverine at
various times before or after virus infection.  Pretreatment with papaverine at 24, 12 or 2 h before virus infection resulted in no inhibition of the CMV yields, nor the enhancement of antiviral activity when followed by post-treatment at 0 h PI. 
Addition of papaverine at early times after virus infection through 6 h PI gave virtually identical inhibitory effects on CMV replication.  With the addition of drug after 6 h, the effect of papaverine dropped approximately 5- to 10-fold with each
successive 12 to 24 h delay; however, the addition of papaverine as late as 48 h PI resulted in a significant inhibition of CMV yields.
<BR><BR>2.  Viral DNA synthesis
<BR><BR>a. HSV-1 DNA synthesis
<BR><BR>The time of addition studies suggested this antiviral effect was most pronounced when papaverine was added before the time of initiation of CMV DNA synthesis.  The possibility that smooth muscle-relaxing agents were inhibiting viral DNA synthesis
was first examined by testing the effect of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers or papaverine on the synthesis of DNA in cells infected with HSV-1.  The experiments were designed so that total radioactivity from infected cells was representative of the rate of
HSV-1 DNA synthesis because at the time of radioactive labelling cellular DNA synthesis is almost completely shut down.  A representative drug from each of the three classes of Ca.sup.++ influx blockers was tested for its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis
in SM cells infected with HSV-1 strain KOS.  Treatment of infected cells with verapamil or nifedipine at 30 ug/ml inhibited the incorporation of radioactive thymidine by 51-60%.  Diltiazem was not inhibitory.  Ca.sup.++ influx blockers, however,
inhibited the incorporation of .sup.3 H-thymidine in mock-infected cells more efficiently than in HSV-1 infected cells.  The results with papaverine were similar to those observed with Ca.sup.++ influx blockers except that both mock-infected cells had
similar levels of inhibition of DNA synthesis.
<BR><BR>b. CMV DNA synthesis
<BR><BR>In CMV-infected cells, cellular DNA synthesis is stimulated in the early phase of virus infection, but during the late phase nearly all DNA synthesized is of virus origin.  Thus, measurement of .sup.3 H-thymidine incorporated during the late
phase of CMV infection represents CMV-specific DNA synthesis.  Treatment of CMV-infected cells with Ca.sup.++ influx blockers resulted in a substantial decrease in the rate of CMV DNA synthesis.  Again, more efficient inhibition of DNA synthesis occurred
in mock-infected cells than in virus-infected cells.  The level of inhibition of DNA synthesis of CMV-infected cells was lower than the level of inhibition of CMV yield.
<BR><BR>Papaverine is the most potent of the smooth muscle-relaxing agents which inhibit the replication of CMV.  More than 100,000-fold inhibition of CMV replication usually is observed with 30 ug/ml of papaverine.  When the effect of papaverine on the
synthesis of DNA in cells infected with CMV was tested, however, only a 91% or 11-fold inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed.  Apparently this reduction in the rate of incorporation of .sup.3 H-thymidine represented inhibition of DNA synthesis rather
than a delay.  When a time-course study done with 10 ug/ml of papaverine, no displacement of the pattern of CMV DNA synthesis was observed; in contrast, the extent of inhibition increased with elapsed time after infection and papaverine treatment as
illustrated by Table 12.
<BR><BR> TABLE 12  ______________________________________ Effect of Papaverine on the synthesis of DNA in SM  Cells Infected with CMV: A Kinetic Study  Labeling period  CPM Percent  (h PI) No papaverine  Papaverine inhibition

infected with CMV (strain Ad169) at a MOI of 3.4 PFU/ml. Papaverine was  added at 0 h PI to make an initial concentration of 10 ug/ml. Medium was  changed at 48 h PI with fresh papaverine. Concentrated .sup.3 H--thymidin  (specific activity = 20 Ci/mmol)
was added at the times indicated after  CMV infection to a final concentration of 10 uCi/ml.
<BR><BR>The disparity between the levels of inhibition achieved by papaverine of virus yield and virus DNA synthesis suggested that inhibition of CMV resulted from mechanisms which affected replication steps other than just DNA synthesis, or that the
papaverine was not being applied at the optimal time.  A time of addition study was designed and done at a MOI of 3.4 PFU/cell.  Pretreatment of cells with papaverine had no effect on CMV DNA synthesis.  Treatment of cells with papaverine at any time
from 0 to 24 h PI resulted in a similar level of inhibition of DNA synthesis: about 90% to 95%.
<BR><BR>In spite of numerous experiments which were performed on CMV DNA synthesis, it was possible that cellular DNA synthesis was making a much larger contribution to the overall rate of .sup.3 H-thymidine incorporation than predicted.  To determine if
the radioactivity measured in CMV-infected cells was truly representative of CMV DNA synthesis, viral and cellular DNA were separated using CsCl density gradient centrifugation.  FIG. 10 shows the radio-activity measured in each fraction collected from
the bottom of representative gradients.  At 72-96 h PI, almost no cellular DNA was found; most of the radioactivity was found in a peak with the recognized density (1.716 g/cm.sup.3) of CMV DNA.  Since from 72 to 96 h PI, CMV DNA synthesis reaches the
maximum rate at this relatively high MOI, it is unlikely that cellular DNA synthesis contributed sufficiently to the overall rate of .sup.3 H-thymidine incorporation to result in the erroneous interpretation of the earlier data.
<BR><BR>F. Structure-activity relationships of papaverine-related compounds
<BR><BR>Since papaverine has proven to be the most potent anti-CMV drug tested in our protocols thus far, studies of the structural specificity of the antiviral action of papaverine were initiated by comparing the antiviral activities of several
compounds which are structurally related to papaverine and commercially available.  Glaucine, laudanosine, salsolidine and tetrahydropapaverine were tested.  Their structures, as well as the structure of papaverine, are shown in FIG. 11.  All these drugs
were dissolved in 70% ethanol to make stock solutions with an initial concentration of 40 mg/ml.  Subsequent dilutions were mode with water to make working solutions of 10 mg/ml.
<BR><BR>Results of virus yield assays in the presence or absence of drugs from this group of isoquinolines are shown in Table 13.  No significant inhibition of CMV replication was observed with these drugs.  Only tetrahydropapaverine at the highest
concentration resulted in more than 10-fold inhibition of CMV replication.  Controls consisting of ethanol at a concentration corresponding to that contained in the highest concentration of the drugs tested were examined for antiviral effects and 3- to
4-fold inhibition of CMV replication was observed.
<BR><BR>Therefore, tentatively, recognizing that this is a single experiment, it appears that the nitrogen on the isoquinoline ring with an electron available for covalent bond formation is critical to the antiviral activity of papaverine.  When hydrogen
occupies this site (tetrahydropapaverine), then the inhibitory activity is reduced from 99,99982% inhibition to 89% inhibition at equimolar doses of 100 u M. When a methyl group occupies this site (laudanosine), the antiviral activity is lost almost
entirely.  The results with salsolidine and glaucine add further support to this view.  It will be appreciated that those papaverine family agents not found to have appreciable antiviral activity do not have a true isoquinoline ring in that the
aromaticity of the ring is lost upon addition of substituents to the ring nitrogen.  Moreover, an additional papaverine family agent which has shown good antiviral activity, ethaverine, does have an isoquinoline ring (ethaverine has the same chemical
structure as papaverine except with ethoxy groups in place of the four methoxy groups of papaverine).  Therefore, the present invention is directed in particular to papaverine family agents having the aromatic isoquinoline ring.

<BR><BR>G. Inhibition of CMV and HSV-1 Replication by Combined Treatment with Interferon and Ca.sup.++ Influx blockers.
<BR><BR>In addition to demonstrating synergistic action when administered to infected cells in combination with each other, the pharmacologic agents disclosed by the present invention exhibit a synergistic antiviral when administered in combination with
alpha interferon (IFN alpha).  This was demonstrated by treating infected cells with a combination which included IFN alpha and verapamil.  THY cells were treated with 1000 U/ml of recombinant type IFN alpha (obtained from Schering, Kenilworth, N.J.) 24
h before CMV infection.  After CMV infection the cells were treated with 1000 U/ml of IFN alpha and/or 15 ug/ml of verapamil.  Media were changed at 48 h PI.  Virus yields were measured at 96 h PI.  As seen in Table 14, CMV replication was inhibited by
1.9-fold with 15 ug/ml of verapamil and by 3.6-fold with 1000 U/ml of IFN alpha.  Combined treatment with verapamil and IFN alpha gave a 26.3-fold inhibition of CMV yield.  This number is almost 5-fold higher than 5.5 which is the sum of the levels of
inhibition of the two drugs alone (3.6 and 1.9).

of HSV-1 yields and 30 ug/ml of verapamil resulted in 33-fold inhibition.  Combined treatment of 2000 U/ml of IFN alpha and 30 ug/ml of verapamil gave a 500-fold inhibition of HSV-1 yield.

doses as low as 3.7 u g/ml.  A high concentration of verapamil (33 u g/ml) and lower dose of IFN alpha (111 U/ml) resulted in little synergistic effect.

<BR><BR>H. Inhibition of Intracellular Free Calcium Response by Papaverine
<BR><BR>Until now, the only known pharmacological activity of papaverine was the inhibition of the phosphodiesterase activities associated with the breakdown of cyclic nucleotides.  However, the data summarized in FIG. 12 and Table 18 convincingly
demonstrate that papaverine inhibits the intracellular free calcium response which is associated with CMV and other viral infections.
<BR><BR>FIG. 12 is a compilation of data from experiments wherein THY cells, grown to confluency in 25 cm.sup.2 flasks, were infected with CMV (strain AD-169; 3 PFU/cell).  The intracellular free [Ca.sup.++ ] was measured by Quin-2 fluorescence.  As can
be seen from the data displayed in FIG. 12, papaverine, when administered to the cells at a concentration of 30 ug/ml, resulted in virtually a 100% inhibition of the fluorescence response by 48 hours post infection.  This data has been tabularized in the
following table, Table 18.

<BR><BR>In further experiments, the effect of papaverine on the intracellular free calcium response was shown to be dose-dependent.  For example, Table 19 is a compilation of data which demonstrates the dose-dependent nature of papaverine's effects in
this regard.  In Table 19 it is shown that upon CMV infection at an MOI of 3.5, a 105% enhancement in the Quin-2 fluorescence was noted.  However, treatment with papaverine at 100, 10 and 1 u M concentrations resulted in inhibitions of this fluorescence
response of 66, 30 and -3%, respectively, which thus is indicative of a dose dependent effect.

<BR><BR>Moreover, as displayed in the following table, Table 20, the data further indicated that this inhibitory effect was exerted when papaverine was added through the first 24 hours after CMV infection.
<BR><BR> TABLE 20  ______________________________________ Effect of Papaverine Added at Different Times Postinfection  on the CMV-induced Intracellular Free [Ca.sup.++ ] Response  Treatment Fluorescence  Enhancement.sup.2  CMV.sup.3  Papaverine.sup.4

<BR><BR>Thus, papaverine inhibition of the intracellular free CA.sup.++ response is directly associated with papaverine interference of CMV replication.  The sensitivity of the Ca.sup.++ response and CMV replication to inhibition by papaverine were
similar.  Time of addition studies also support this correlation.  Since CMV replication results in yields that are about 10.sup.6 -fold greater than the base level of infectivity, the assay of CMV yields provides for about 10.sup.6 -fold signal for the
amplified effect of papaverine on intracellular free [Ca.sup.++ ].
<BR><BR>It appears, therefore, that the inhibitory activity of papaverine towards intracellular free Ca.sup.++ responses is likely not necessarily the result of its purported cyclic nucleotide modulating activity.  First, the replication of
cytomegalovirus is extraordinarily sensitive to inhibition by papaverine (ED.sub.90 =1.6 uM), but much less sensitive to inhibition by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) which is reported to have a cyclic nucleotide modulating activity that is similar to
papaverine.  Second, if inhibition of CMV replication were associated with rising levels of cAMP, as would be the case with papaverine, then forskolin or dibutryl cAMP should have similar inhibitory effect.  These two drugs, however, have a much less
substantial effect on CMV replication.  It could be argued that induction of both cyclic nucleotides was necessary for inhibition of CMV replication.
<BR><BR>This possibility was tested with IBMX and cotreatment of injected cels with forskolin and nitroprusside, (which induces higher levels of cGMP) or with both dibutyryl cyclic nucleotides.  None of these treatments resulted in an inhibition of CMV
replication which was comparable to papaverine's effects.  Finally, replication of CMV rather than inhibition of replication of CMV was associated with rising levels of both cAMP and cGMP.  Furthermore, papaverine inhibition of CMV replication could be
partially reversed by forskolin treatment which also partially reversed the inhibitory effect of papaverine on the CMV-induced increase in cAMP.  Thus, the increase in cAMP appears to be specifically associated with CMV replication rather than inhibition
of CMV replication.
<BR><BR>I. Combination Treatment With Papaverine and DHPG
<BR><BR>DHPG is a synthetic nucleoside analog which has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of viral, and in particular CMV, infections.  However, DHPG treatment results in various undesirable side effects.  Papaverine is also a potent inhibitor of viral
infections, but papaverine treatment is not associated with a high frequency of undesirable side-effects.  Surprisingly, it has been found that when these two agents are co-administered to viral infected cells, such co-administration exhibits a greatly
enhanced antiviral synergistic efficacy.  This finding is displayed in Table 21, which is a compilation of data from experiments wherein infected virtually cells were treated with various dose-combinations of the two agents.
<BR><BR>As can be seen in Table 21, when DHPG was administered alone at a concentration of 3 uM, a viral inhibition of about 72-fold was observed.  Moreover, when papaverine was administered alone at a concentration of 1.5 uM, a viral inhibition of about
8.7-fold was observed.  However, when co-administered at these same respective concentrations, a 3000-fold inhibition was observed.

<BR><BR>From the data displayed in Table 21, it should also be appreciated that lower levels of DHPG, when co-administered with papaverine, have equal or greater activity than the highest level of DHPG when administered alone.  This indicates that DHPG
doses can be reduced, thus reducing the DHPG-associated toxicities, when co-administered with papaverine.
<BR><BR>Moreover, due to the fact that the antiviral nucleoside analogs function by similar mechanisms, papaverine will also prove of benefit when co-administered with other such agents, or their function equivalents or derivatives.  For example,
papaverine may be co-administered with Ara-C (cytosine arabinoside), Ara-A (adenosine arabinoside), or Acyclovir (acycloguanosine, the parent compound of DHPG), to achieve the benefits afforded by the present invention.  Moreover, although the papaverine
family members shown in FIG. 11 and Table 13 were not found to have particularly high antiviral activity, dioxyline (Paveril) is one Papaverine family member which is useful in antiviral therapy.  Note that, unlike those agents displayed in FIG. 11,
dioxyline does have a true isoquinoline ring which is believed to be necessary for antiviral activity.  Additionally, another papaverine family agent having an isoquinoline ring and shown to have similar antiviral activity as papaverine is ethaverine,
which has the same structure as papaverine except that it includes ethoxy groups in place of the four methoxy groups of papaverine.  Therefore, all papaverine family agents having an isoquinoline ring structure are believed to provide the benefits of the
present invention.
<BR><BR>The findings that the present agents are active in treating virus-infected human tissue culture cells suggest that such agents will prove useful in treating viral infections in man.  The agents do not undergo appreciable entero-hepatic metabolism
prior to distribution throughout the body, nor do they require metabolism for "activation." Likewise, these viral diseases present similar morphologic changes in infected cells both in vivo and in vitro.  For many years, it has been shown that in vitro
antiviral activity typically correlates with in vivo activity.  In contrast, the main problem has often been the finding of untoward reactions (toxicities) in vivo that were not seen in vitro.  Since the present agents are in clinical use, this will not
be a problem.  Therefore, it is expected that these agents can be administered to an infected patient by all routes presently indicated for their use.  It is further expected that topical preparations will be active in treating lesions associated with
viral infection of this sort.
<BR><BR>The instant invention has been disclosed in connection with standard laboratory procedures used by the applicant.  However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that variations may be undertaken without departing from the spirit and
scope of the invention.  More specifically, it will be apparent that certain agents that are both chemically and pharmacologically related may be substituted to achieve the observed antiviral effect.  For example, methoxyverapamil and verapamil are
virtually indistinguishable pharmacologically as are papaverine and dioxyline and would be expected to give similar results.  Additionally, although the present invention is disclosed in terms of activity against CMV and the herpes viruses, it is
contemplated that the present agents are effective in treating other viral infections.  These and similar substitutes will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are within the spirit and scope of the invention.
