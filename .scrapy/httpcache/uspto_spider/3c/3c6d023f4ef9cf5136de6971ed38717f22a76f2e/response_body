</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p>The present invention provides improved cell delivery compositions. In
     particular, the invention provides biocompatible endosomolytic agents. In
     a preferred embodiment, the endosomolytic agents are also biodegradable
     and can be broken down within cells into components that the cells can
     either reuse of dispose of. In one aspect, the present invention provides
     endosomolytic agents capable of effecting the lysis of an endosome in
     response to a change in pH, and methods for effecting the lysis of an
     endosome. These inventive endosomolytic agents obviate the need for known
     agents (i.e., <B><I>chloroquine,</I></B> fusogenic peptides, inactivated adenoviruses
     and polyethyleneimine) that can burst endosomes and have negative effects
     on cells. In another aspect, the present invention provides cell delivery
     compositions comprising an endosomolytic component that is capable of
     effecting the lysis of the endosome in response to a change in pH, and an
     encapsulating, or packaging, component capable of packaging a therapeutic
     agent to be delivered to cellular or subcellular components.

<BR><BR>The recent advances in drug discovery and molecular and pharmaceutical biology have created a need for the development of effective mechanisms for delivering therapeutic agents into cells.  In but one example, researchers have particularly
struggled to develop efficient means for introducing nucleic acids into cells.  The development of a method to efficiently introduce nucleic acids into cells would be useful, for example, in gene therapy, antisense therapy, research purposes (e.g., to
study cell differentiation, growth and carcinogenic transformation or for the creation of animal models for human disease; see, for example, Abdallah, Biol.  Cell, 1995, 85, 1, and references therein).
<BR><BR>An efficient way in which nature has accomplished the task of delivering biological agents into cells is through the evolution of viruses specifically to mediate the transfer of genetic materials into cells.  Although viruses are ideal vectors
for gene therapy because they have the highest levels of transfection efficiency known, the human immune system has likewise evolved to counteract viral infections, thus making virus-based gene therapy in humans potentially unsafe.  Because of this
characteristic of viral gene delivery systems, non-viral, or synthetic, gene delivery systems have been created to mediate the transfer of therapeutic agents into cells.  Unfortunately, existing techniques for delivering nucleic acids to cells are
limited by poor efficiency and/or high toxicity of the delivery reagents.  A particular problem is encountered with techniques that rely on receptor-mediated endocytosis because the nucleic acid to be delivered is often destroyed when exposed to the low
pH and active degradatory machinery of the endosome/lysosome.  Various reagents (e.g., chloroquine, polyethyleneimine [PEI], certain highly charged cationic compounds, fusogenic peptides, and inactivated adenoviruses) have been developed that are
intended to quickly disrupt the endosome in order to minimize the amount of time that a delivered nucleic acid spends in this hostile environment.  Specifically, two delivery systems that have obtained recognition as the forerunners for in vivo gene
therapy are those based on polymers and on lipids.
<BR><BR>The first polymer used for a gene delivery system was polylysine (Wu, G. Y., Wu, C. H. J Biol.  Chem. 1988, 263, 14621), in which the polylysine was complexed with plasmid DNA and evaluated for its ability to mediate the transfection of cells. 
Polylysine continues to be a common choice for the study of gene transfer, however, the gene expression mediated by polylysine, and other like polycations, is low.  In an effort to increase the transfection efficiency of polylysine and other like
polycations, agents designed to destabilize the endosome have been typically used in conjunction with lysine.  One example of such an agent is chloroquine, which is a weak base that buffers the endosome to maintain a neutral endosomal pH.  This buffering
effect serves two functions to increase transfection efficiency (Seglen, P. O. "Inhibitors of lysosomal function" Methods Enzymol.  1983, 96, 737).  First, the enzymes of the lysosome (which fuses with the endosome to form a secondary lysosome) have
maximum activity in an acidic medium.  Therefore, buffering of the vesicle diminishes the activity of the enzymes including nucleases that can degrade the therapeutic plasmid DNA.  Second, the buffering effect may also act to cause vesicle expansion and
subsequent destabilization of the endosome.  While chloroquine provides an effective system to study the transfection efficiencies of delivery systems in vitro, its use in vivo is unrealistic owing to the high local concentrations required to increase
the gene expression.  One substitute utilized for chloroquine includes glycerol, which has recently been shown to enhance gene expression in vitro.  However, 1-1.5 M glycerol is required to enhance transfection, thus also making glycerol impractical for
in vivo gene transfer Zauner, W.; Kichler, A., Schmidt.  W.; Sinski, A.; Wagner, E. Biotechniques 1996, 20, 905).  Other approaches used to increase the gene expression by polylysine/DNA conjugates rely on virus or virus components.  For example, the
addition of adenovirus to a polylysine/DNA complex increased transfection levels over 2000 times in vitro (Wu, G. Y.; Zhan, P.; Sze, L. L.; Rosenberg, A. R.; Wu, C. H. J. Biol.  Chem. 1994, 269, 11542), and conjugation of endosomolytic peptides to
polylysine/DNA complexes increased transfection efficiency more than 1000 times in vitro (Plank, C.; Oberhauser, B.; Mechtler, K.; Koch, C.; Wagner, E. J. Biol.  Chem. 1994, 269, 12918).  However, the inclusion of potentially immunogenic protein-based
endosomolytic agents into gene delivery systems may significantly diminish the utility of the conjugate for repeated use in vivo.
<BR><BR>Another synthetic polymer that has been recently evaluated for its ability to mediate gene transfer is polyethyleneimine (PEI) which contains primary, secondary, and tertiary amines (Abdallah, B.; Hassan, A.; Benoist; Goula, D.; Behr, J. P.;
Demeneix, B. A. Human Gene Therapy 1996, 7, 1947; Boussif, O.; Lezoualc'h, F.; Zanta, M. A.; Mergny, M. D., Scherman, D.; Demeneix, B.; Behr, J. P. Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA 1995, 92, 7297).  The advantage of PEI over polylysine as a mediator for
gene transfer is that it contains a built-in mechanism for endosome escape.  The overall protonation of PEI at pH=7 is approximately 20% whereas the overall protonation at pH=5 is approximately 45% (Suh, J.; Paik, H. J.; Hwang, B. K. Bioorg.  Chem. 1994,
22, 318).  These different protonation levels suggest that PEI is capable of buffering the endosome in the same manner as chloroquine.  In fact, PEI is capable of mediating gene transfer equal to the best lipid systems.  However, while PEI demonstrates
that the synthetic "built-in" mechanism for endosomal rupture works well to mediate gene transfer, PEI is toxic to cells in vitro (Personal experimental evaluation, MIT, April 1998).
<BR><BR>In addition to synthetic polymers, lipids have also been extensively studied for uses in gene therapy.  These lipids are generally cationic lipids containing a positively charged head group and a hydrophobic tail.  The first widely recognized
lipid-based DNA delivery system was a mixture of DOTMA (N-1,2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N, N-trimethylammonium chloride) and DOPE (dioleoyloxy phosphatidylethanolamine) known as Lipofectin (Felgner, P. L.; Gadek, T. R.; Holm, M.; Roman, R.; Chan, H. W.;
Wenz, M.; Norhrop, J. P.; Ringold, G. M.; Daneilsen, M. Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1987, 84, 7413).  Since Lipofectin was introduced many lipid-based gene transfer systems were synthesized, such as DOGS (dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine), DDAB
(dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide) and DOTAP ([1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane).  Although lipid-based systems generally have transfection efficiencies superior to polymer-based systems, their levels of transfection are still generally
insufficient for practical clinical somatic gene therapy.
<BR><BR>Although attempts have been made to improve each of these known endosomolytic agents, they still possess toxicity problems and other disadvantages.  Clearly, a versatile and biocompatible synthetic cell delivery system, preferably biodegradable,
would be important for the clinical success of gene delivery and the delivery of other therapeutic agents.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention provides improved cell delivery systems.  In particular, the invention provides a novel endosomolytic agent capable of effecting the lysis of an endosome in response to a change in pH.  The inventive endosomolytic agents
obviate the need for known agents (i.e., chloroquine, fusogenic peptides, inactivated adenoviruses and polyethyleneimine) that can burst endosomes but that have negative effects on cells.  In certain preferred embodiments, this endosomolytic agent
comprises a compound having at least one hydrolyzable functional moiety, and wherein said compound is capable of undergoing a hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition and effecting lysis of the endosome in response to a change in pH.  In a particularly
preferred embodiment, this functional moiety comprises an ortho-ester.  In certain other embodiments, the endosomolytic agent comprises a compound having synergistic components.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, this synergistic agent comprises a
compound having at least one hydrolyzable functional moiety, and at least one other functional moiety capable of undergoing an ionization event, wherein the compound is capable of undergoing a hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition and effecting lysis of the
endosome in response to a change in pH.
<BR><BR>In another aspect, the invention also provides a cell delivery system comprising the endosomolytic agent or component as described above, and additionally a packaging component.  In one embodiment, the cell delivery system is formulated as a
polymer, wherein monomers comprising encapsulating components and endosomolytic components, are polymerized as a single linear or a branched polymer.  In another embodiment, the cell delivery system is formulated as a mixture of endosomolytic and
encapsulating components, but are not copolymerized.  Whether copolymerized or formulated as a mixture, any appropriate combination of components may be utilized that results in delivery of a desired agent to the cell or subcellular component. 
Particularly preferred agents to be delivered include, but are not limited to therapeutic agents such as nucleic acids, biomolecules and small molecules, however one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that other agents to be delivered to cells,
including, but not limited to contrast agents, could be utilized in the present invention.
<BR><BR>As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the endosomolytic agents and the cell delivery agents of the present invention must be of appropriate size to fit inside an endosomal compartment, along with any agent to be delivered to the cell. Inventive agents and compositions are therefore preferably less than about 150 nm in size, or are capable of adopting a conformation less than about 150 nm in size for purposes of uptake via endocytosis.

<BR><BR>In recognition of the importance of the development of a safe and effective cell delivery system, the present invention provides improved compositions and methods for the delivery of therapeutic agents to cells and subcellular components.  In one
aspect, the present invention provides an endosomolytic system that is capable of effecting the lysis of an endosome in response to a change in pH, and methods for effecting the lysis of an endosome.  These inventive endosomolytic agents obviate the need
for known agents (i.e., chloroquine, fusogenic peptides, inactivated adenoviruses and polyethyleneimine) that can burst endosomes and have negative effects on cells.  In another aspect, the present invention provides cell delivery compositions comprising
an endosomolytic component that is capable of effecting the lysis of the endosome in response to a change in pH, and an encapsulating component capable of packaging a therapeutic agent to be delivered to cellular or subcellular components.  In
particularly preferred embodiments, the endosomolytic systems are biodegradable and/or bioresorbable.
<BR><BR>Certain examples of preferred embodiments of endosomolytic systems and cell delivery systems will be described below.
<BR><BR>Endosomolytic Agents
<BR><BR>As discussed above, the present invention provides improved agents and systems for the delivery of compounds to cells and the lysis of endosomal cell compartments.  These improved agents and systems are capable of lysing an endosome and/or
releasing an agent from an endosome in response to a change in pH.  In particular, the invention provides biocompatible, preferably biodegradable, endosomolytic agents.  As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the endosomolytic agents of the
present invention must be of appropriate size to fit inside an endosomal compartment, along with any agent to be delivered to the cell.  Inventive agents are therefore less than about 150 nm in size, or are capable of adopting a conformation less than
about 150 mm in size for purposes of uptake via endocytosis.
<BR><BR>While the mechanism of action of the endosomolytic system is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, preferred agents comprise compounds having one or more functional moieties that are capable, in response to a change in pH, of
undergoing a hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition and releasing an agent known to disrupt lipid bilayers.  In certain preferred embodiments, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition is initiated by the hydrolysis of specific functional moieties in the
endosomolytic agent.  This hydrolysis additionally results in the release of an agent capable of disrupting lipid bilayers thus lysing an endosome.  A particularly preferred biocompatible agent capable of disrupting lipid bilayers includes, but is not
limited to, ethanol.
<BR><BR>In certain other embodiments, the endosomolytic agent comprises a compound having components capable of acting in a synergistic manner.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, this synergistic agent comprises a compound having at least one
hydrolyzable functional moiety, and at least one other functional moiety capable of undergoing an ionization event, wherein the compound is capable of undergoing a hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition and effecting lysis of the endosome in response to a
change in pH.
<BR><BR>Although in principle any compound having any combination of the above-described characteristics can be utilized, particularly preferred endosomolytic agents are polymers comprised of one or more monomers having one or more functionalities
capable of effecting the hydrophobic/hydrophilic transition and/or release of an endosomolytic agent.  In preferred embodiments, these polymers are prepared from monomers having one or more hydrolyzable functional moieties.  In other preferred
embodiments, these polymers are prepared from any combination of monomers having one or more hydrolyzable functional moieties and monomers having functional moieties capable of undergoing an ionization event.
<BR><BR>In but one example, a preferred hydrolyzable moiety present in the inventive endosomolytic agent comprises an ortho-ester functionality.  At pH=7, the ortho-ester is stable upon formation of the nanoparticles, however, at pH&lt;5, which is
encountered in the endosomal compartment, the ortho-ester functionality hydrolyzes, releases the endosomolytic compound ethanol, and thus is transformed into a hydrophilic diol functionality which is capable of effecting escape from the endosomal
compartment into the cytoplasm.  As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, an endosomolytic agent can be prepared from monomers having ortho-ester functionalities, which are then subsequently polymerized.
<BR><BR>In but one example, as shown in FIG. 1, the monomer N-[2-methyl-1,3-O-ethoxyethylidine-propanediol]methacrylamide (2) is synthesized from N-[2-methyl-1,3.20 propanediol]methacrylamide (1).  This compound (1) can be readily synthesized by
acylation of an amino diol with methacryloyl chloride according to literature procedure (Jedlinski, Z.; Paprotny, J. Roczniki Chemii 1986, 40, 1487) in which 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol was reacted with methacryloyl chloride at -10.degree.  C. in
acetonitrile for 24 hours.  This compound contains two primary alcohols in a 1,3 configuration making it ideal for diol protection via an ortho-ester, as shown below in FIG. 1.  Subsequent reaction, (according to literature procedure Miller, V.; Yang,
D.; Weigel, T.; OHan, O.; Liu, H. J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 4175) with triethylorthoacetate in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluene sulfonic acid and recrystallization from acetone yields (2), which can then subsequently be polymerized to yield
an inventive endosomolytic agent.
<BR><BR>Other particularly preferred monomers for use in the preparation of inventive endosomolytic agents include, but are not limited to tartaric acid protected by ortho-ester formation, threitol protected by orthoester formation, and dithiothreitol
protected by ortho-ester formation.  Each of these can subsequently be polymerized to yield polyesters, polycarbonates, and polydisulfides, respectively, for use as endosomolytic agents, as also shown in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR>Although FIG. 2 depicts the use of ortho-ester protected tartaric acid, threitol, and dithiotheitol monomers, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that other monomers having functionalities capable of being protected using an ortho-ester
functionality can be utilized.  Additionally, one of ordinary skill in the art will also realize that the present invention is not limited to the use of ortho-ester functionalities; rather other functionalities capable of undergoing a transformation in
response to a change in pH (generally from pH=7 to pH&lt;5) upon endocytosis, and releasing an endosomolytic compound, can be utilized, including, but not limited to functionalities such as hydrazones and cis-actonyls.  Moreover, it will also be realized
that the preparation of inventive endosomolytic agents is not limited to the use of like monomers, such as those having only ortho-ester functionalities; rather, any combination of functionalities, for example, ortho-esters, hydrazones, and cis-actonyls,
to name a few, may be utilized to prepare the inventive endosomolytic agents.  These monomers may be associated with one another covalently (e.g., as a result of free radical polymerization) or otherwise, so long as the resulting endosomolytic agents are
capable of lysing an endosome and are preferably also biocompatible.
<BR><BR>As a variation of the use of a combination of a collection of monomers as described above, in another preferred embodiment, the endosomolytic agent is formulated from a combination of two or more monomers that exhibit a synergistic effect
resulting in the lysis of the endosomal compartment.  The endosomolytic agent comprises at least one monomer having a hydrolyzable moiety, including, but not limited to the ortho-ester functionality discussed above, and at least one other monomer having
one or more functional moieties capable of undergoing an ionization event.
<BR><BR>In but one example, an inventive synergistic system is prepared by combining a monomer having an ortho-ester functionality, which forms a hydrophilic diol following hydrolysis, with a ionizable comonomer such as N-methacryloyl-L-histidine that is
capable of being protonated and increases the hydrophilicity of the polymer at pH=5, thus allowing the escape of the therapeutic agent to be delivered from the hydrophobic polymer matrix into the cytoplasm.
<BR><BR>As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, as discussed above, the inventive endosomolytic agents may be prepared from any combination of monomers having functionalities such as ortho-esters, hydrazones and cis-actonyls capable of release
of an endosomolytic compound, and monomers capable of undergoing an ionization event, to provide inventive endosomolytic agents that function via a synergistic effect.  These monomers may be associated with one another covalently (e.g., via free radical
polymerization) or otherwise so long as the resulting endosomolytic agents are capable of lysing an endosome and are preferably also biocompatible.
<BR><BR>Cell Delivery Systems
<BR><BR>It is particularly preferred that the inventive endosomolytic agents are also utilized in combination with an encapsulating/delivery agent to provide an inventive cell delivery system.  In one preferred embodiment, the endosomolytic agent or
component and the encapsulating component comprise monomers that are copolymerized to provide an inventive cell delivery system.  In another preferred embodiment, the endosomolytic component and the encapsulating component are not copolymerized, but are
rather provided as a mixture to yield the inventive cell delivery system.  The selection of the encapsulating component for use in accordance with the cell delivery system of the present invention, of course, depends on the compound to be delivered.  The
encapsulating component is any entity, preferably biocompatible and biodegradable, that interacts with the compound to be delivered in such a way as to mediate its introduction into a cell.
<BR><BR>In one particularly preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agent to be delivered to the cell is DNA, and thus preferred encapsulating/packaging agents include compounds with a high charge density such as cationic polymers, particularly those
synthesized from tertiary amines and quaternary amines.  In but one example, the monomer 2-[dimethylamino]ethyl methacrylate can be utilized.  Other particularly preferred cationic monomers include, but are not limited to (3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide,
2-aminoethyl methacrylamide, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, as shown in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR>Although tertiary amines are more particularly preferred, quaternary amines such as trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride can be utilized.  As one of ordinary skill in the art, the cell delivery composition can also be synthesized using a
combination of encapsulating components, similarly to utilizing a combination of endosomolytic components having a synergistic effect, to achieve encapsulation/packaging of a therapeutic agent.
<BR><BR>As discussed previously, the individual monomers having encapsulating characteristics and endosomolytic characteristics are polymerized using standard reactions including, but not limited to free radical polymerizations.  In but one example, for
free radical polymerizations, initiator type, monomer/initiator ratio, polymerization temperature, polymerization time, polymerization solvent and comonomer ratio is varied.  These parameters are known to influence the final properties of the polymer. 
FIG. 4 depicts one example of the copolymerization of monomers having encapsulating characteristics and endosomolytic characteristics via free radical polymerization.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will, using known techniques, be able to prepare
any of a variety of cell delivery compositions that can readily be tested according to the teachings herein to identify those with desirable delivery characteristics.  These compositions preferably have sufficient endosomolytic character to lyse
endosomes, and sufficient encapsulation character to package therapeutic agents.
<BR><BR>As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the resulting collection of polymers can rigorously be characterized using several established methods such as determining monomer molar ratios and structural determination using .sup.1 H and
.sup.13 C NMR spectroscopy, in which characteristic peaks can determined using homopolymers of each monomer and the ratio of these peaks can be used to quantify the ratios of the monomers in each polymer synthesized.  Other characterization techniques
familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art include, but are not limited to elemental analysis, multi-detector (laser light scattering, differential viscometry, and differential refractometry) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
<BR><BR>Once the polymers have been characterized, the encapsulation capability of the inventive system is tested.  In but one example, DNA-containing nanoparticles are formulated for the pH sensitive polymers using a variety of methods, including, but
not limited to spontaneous emulsification, sonication, or homogenization, and are evaluated for particle size formation.  Spontaneous emulsification is a particularly preferred method because this method has been reported to effectively encapsulate
hydrophilic compounds in hydrophobic polymer matrices without resulting DNA damage.
<BR><BR>In but one example, the ability of DNA to escape from the cell delivery composition, is evaluated using labeled polymers in cultured cells including, but not limited to, COS-7 (monkey fibroblast), HepG2 (human hepatoblastoma) and P388D1 (mouse
macrophage), which can then be subsequently evaluated using confocal microscopy.
<BR><BR>As discussed previously, the biocompatibility of the inventive system is particularly preferred.  Biocompatiblity is if a primary concern for a proposed polymer-based gene delivery system.  Although escape from the endosome is necessary for high
transfection efficiency, biocompatibility of the delivery system is also required because a delivery system that is incompatible with a cell on the molecular level is apt to disrupt the normal cellular biochemistry, likely resulting in a low overall
transfection efficiency.  For gene therapy, biocomptability is a function of efficacy.  Using cell lines, including, but not limited to, COS-7, HepG2, and P388D1, the biocompatibility of the abovementioned compounds can be determined as a function of the
increasing concentration of these compounds to evaluate the safety of the inventive system.  Although the abovementioned example (discussed further in Examples 4 and 5) focuses on the delivery of nucleic acids, one of ordinary skill in the art will
realize that standard techniques in the art can be utilized to evaluate the ability of other therapeutic agents such as polysaccharides or small molecule drugs, to name a few, to be delivered to cells.
<BR><BR>Targeting Agents
<BR><BR>Furthermore, as one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, it is often desirable to target an agent to be delivered to a particular cell or collection of cells.  A variety of agents that direct compositions to particular cells are known in
the art (see, for example, Cotten et al., Methods Enzym, 217:618, 1993).  Preferred targeting agents are biocompounds, or portions thereof, that interact specifically with individual cells, small groups of cells, or large categories of cells.  Examples
of useful targeting agents include, but are in no way limited to, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), transferrin, asiaglycoproteins, gp120 envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and diptheria toxin, antibodies, and carbohydrates.
<BR><BR>Certain preferred endosomolytic and cell delivery compositions of the present invention include one or more targeting agents associated with (e.g., by covalent, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals, or other interaction) the inventive
endosomolytic agent, the encapsulation/delivery agent, and/or the delivery compound.
<BR><BR>Delivery Compounds
<BR><BR>As discussed previously, in principle, any substance having biological activity or therapeutic utility may be delivered to cells using the endosomolytic and/or cell delivery systems of the present invention.  For example, the invention includes
but is not limited to delivery of proteins, polypeptides, polynucleotides, nucleoproteins, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, and synthetic and biologically engineered analogs thereof.
<BR><BR>Examples of biologically active compounds that might be utilized in a delivery application of the invention include literally any hydrophilic or hydrophobic biologically active compound.  Preferably, though not necessarily, the drug is one that
has already been deemed safe and effective for use by the appropriate governmental agency or body.  For example, drugs for human use listed by the FDA under 21 C.F.R.  .sctn..sctn.  330.5, 331 through 361; 440-460; drugs for veterinary use listed by the
FDA under 21 C.F.R.  .sctn..sctn.  500-582, incorporated herein by reference, are all considered acceptable for use in the present inventive cell delivery composition.
<BR><BR>Biologically active compounds for use in the present invention include any pharmacologically active substances that produce a local or systemic effect in animals, preferably mammals, or humans.  The term thus means any substance intended for use

<BR><BR>Uses
<BR><BR>Those of ordinary skill in the art will immediately appreciate that the present invention can be utilized in a wide variety of applications to deliver agents into cells.  A few particularly preferred applications are discussed in more detail here
in order to highlight some of the characteristics and advantages of the inventive systems.
<BR><BR>As discussed at length above, the present invention is particularly well adapted for delivery of nucleic acids into cells.  As such, the inventive compositions are useful for various applications including gene therapy and antisense regulation. 
To give but a few examples of particular embodiments of nucleic acid delivery applications of the present invention, inventive compositions can be employed to introduce a gene into specific cells or tissue that will express the protein encoded by that
gene and thereby correct a defect caused by a deficiency in that gene in the cells or tissue.  Alternatively, inventive compositions can also be used to turn off the function of a specific gene, for example an oncogene in a tumor cell, by delivering
anti-sense messenger RNA into a cell that will bind with the sense messenger RNA so that translation of the message and therefore expression of the protein encoded by that message will not occur.
<BR><BR>Inventive compositions can be used in therapeutic gene delivery applications, for example to introduce "suicide genes" into cancer cells that will turn on the cell death pathway.  Drug sensitivity genes can also be introduced into tumor cells. 
For example, cells can be genetically engineered to express prodrug activating enzyme, such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, which phosphorylates ganciclovir creating toxic metabolites that kill tumor cells upon exposure to prodrug.
<BR><BR>In the arena of immunotherapy, inventive compositions can be employed in "adoptive immunotherapy" preparations, in which genetically engineered tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are prepared that express tumor necrosis factor and can be used to
treat patients with melanoma.  Immunomodulation of tumor cells to invoke an immune response directed toward specific target cell population is yet another area to which this invention can be applied.
<BR><BR>Of course, as has already been emphasized, the inventive compositions are not limited in their usefulness to delivery of genes, or even nucleic acids; the compositions can alternatively be used to carry a variety of pharmaceutical compositions.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR>Synthesis of N-[2-methyl-1,3-propanediol]methacrylamide: The synthesis of this monomer precursor (1) was performed using a previously described method (Medlinski, Z. and Paprotny, J. Roczniki Chemii 1966, 40, 1487).  The compound was obtained by
acylating 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol with methacryloyl chloride at -10.degree.  C. in acetonitrile for 24 hours.  Following reaction, the product was isolated and purified by repeated recrystallization from acetonitrile to yield the product in 25%
yield, melting point 101.degree.  C.-102.degree.  C. (lit.  102.degree.  C.-103.degree.  C.); Elemental Analysis Calc: C: 55.5%, H: 8.7%, N: 8.1%; Found: C: 55.2%, H: 8.7%, N: 8.0%
<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR>Synthesis of N-[2-methyl-1,3-O-ethoxyethylidine-propanediol]methacrylamide: This monomer is synthesized by reaction of (1) with triethylorthoacetate using a previously reported method (Miller, V.; Yang, D.; Weigel, T.; OHan, O.; Liu, H.; J. Org.
Chem. 1989, 54, 4175).  Briefly, (1) suspended in dichloromethane is reacted for 24 h with triethylorthoacetate in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid.  The solvent is then removed by rotoevaporation and the product is isolated
and purified by repeated recrystallization from acetone.
<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR>Polymer synthesis: Monomer (2) described above and 2-[dimethylamino]ethyl methacrylate (3) (purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and purified by distillation) are polymerized by free radical polymerization under various conditions using a
fractional factorial experimental design.  In this method, the initiator type, monomer/initiator ratio, polymerization temperature, polymerization time, polymerization solvent, and comonomer ratio have been chosen as the variable parameters for
polymerizations.  These parameters are known to most greatly influence the final properties of the polymer (Billmeyer, F. W. Textbook of Polymer Science, John Wiley and Sons, 1984).  Because it is essential that the polymers used for the structure
activity relationship determinations have their exact chemical makeups known, the polymers resulting from the above series of experiments are rigorously conducted.  The monomer molar ratios and structural determination of the polymers are conducted using
.sup.1 H and .sup.13 C NMR spectroscopy.  Characteristic peaks for each monomer are determined using homopolymers of each monomer and the ratio of these peaks are used to quantify the ratios of the monomers in each polymer synthesized.  The elemental
analysis for each polymer are also obtained and the results are correlated to the NMR spectra as a secondary evaluation of the monomer ratios.  The molecular weight of each polymer is determined using multi-detector (laser light scattering, differential
viscometry, and differential refractometry) gel permeation chromatography (GPC).  From the GPC analysis the weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) are calculated.  Also, from the GPC it
is determined if any residual monomers are present in the final polymer.  If residual monomer is found, the polymer will be continuously purified by precipitation until no residual monomer remains.  No polymers that contain residual monomers will be used
for DNA encapsulation experiments, endosomal escape experiments, or biocompatibility experiments.  The glass transition (Tg) and melting (Tm) temperatures of the polymers are analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  Also, any crystalline
structures in the polymers are determined by DSC.
<BR><BR>Example 4
<BR><BR>Nanoparticle Formulation
<BR><BR>The DNA-containing nanoparticles are formulated by spontaneous emulsification as described.  FIG. 5 depicts an example of the nanoparticle formulation with DNA using spontaneous emulsification and shows the size and polydispersity.  The polymer
and plasmid DNA (marker plasmids pCMV-.beta.Gal or pCMV-luc) are dissolved in a cosolvent system consisting of acetone, water, and dichloromethane.  The ratios of the solvents in the cosolvent system are varied with respect to: 1) each other, 2) the
polymer amount, and 3) the plasmid DNA amount, to create a cosolvent system that creates nanoparticles with the desired properties.  This solution is poured into a stirring cosolvent system that creates nanoparticles with the desired properties.  This
solution is poured into a stirring aqueous surfactant solution and the resulting nanoparticle suspension is stirred under vacuum to evaporate the organic solvents.  The nanosuspension is then passed though a 1.0 lm filter and the nanoparticles washed and
isolated by repeated ultracentrifugation.
<BR><BR>Example 5
<BR><BR>Nanoparticle Characterization
<BR><BR>The DNA-containing nanoparticles are thoroughly characterized for their particle size distribution, supercoiled DNA content, encapsulation efficiency, and surface compositions.  The instruments required for the characterization are available
either in our laboratory or departmental facilities.  The particle size distribution of the DNA-containing nanoparticles is determined by quasielastic-laser light scattering (QELS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The QELS provides an average
particle size as well as population distribution whereas SEM provides a visual confirmation of the QELS results.  To maximize the expression of an encoded gene, the supercoiled DNA content of the nanoparticles should be maximized.  The ratio of
supercoiled DNA to the nicked and linear DNA is determined using agarose gel electrophoresis as described.  The nanoparticles are dissolved in dichloromethane and the plasmid DNA extracted with TRIS/EDTA buffer with gentle shaking.  The aqueous phase is
removed, extracted gently with dichloromethane (to remove all polymer) then electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel.  The supercoiled DNA vs.  linear and nicked DNA ratio is determined using a Gel Doc apparatus by integrating the intensity of each DNA band
as a volume, then determining the contribution of the supercoiled DNA band to the total band intensities.  The encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticles is determined using a fluorometric Picogreen assay.  Picogreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.)
is a reagent that is fluorescent when intercalated with double stranded DNA.  The content of DNA in each sphere preparation is then determined by dissolving the nanoparticles in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by selective precipitation of the polymer
in buffer.  The remaining plasmid DNA solution is incubated with Picogreen then quantitated by fluorimetry according to a plasmid standard curve.  The surface composition of the nanoparticles is determined using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) as
previously described (Putnam et al., 8th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Drug Delivery Systems, Feb.  24-27, 1997, pp.  258-259).  The surface composition is important to determine if DNA is adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticle
rather than encapsulated within the hydrophobic polymer matrix.
