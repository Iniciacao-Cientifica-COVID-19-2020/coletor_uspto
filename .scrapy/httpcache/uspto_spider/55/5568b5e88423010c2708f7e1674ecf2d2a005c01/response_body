<BR><BR> This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/GB2015/054069 filed Dec.  18, 2015, claiming priorities based on British Patent Application Nos.  1422670.8, filed Dec.  18, 2014, 1500278.5, filed Jan.  8, 2015, and
1521901.7, filed Dec.  11, 2015, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to the use of certain known compounds in combination with an anti-microbial agent for the treatment of microbial infections.  Additionally the present invention relates to the use of suloctidil or a pharmaceutically
acceptable derivative or prodrug thereof in combination with polymyxin E or polymyxin B or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof for the treatment of microbial infections.  In particular, it relates to the use of such combinations to kill
multiplying and/or clinically latent microorganisms associated with microbial infections.
<BR><BR> Before the introduction of antibiotics, patients suffering from acute microbial infections (e.g. tuberculosis or pneumonia) had a low chance of survival.  For example, mortality from tuberculosis was around 50%.  Although the introduction of
antimicrobial agents in the 1940s and 1950s rapidly changed this picture, bacteria have responded by progressively gaining resistance to commonly used antibiotics.  Now, every country in the world has antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Indeed, more than 70%
of bacteria that give rise to hospital acquired infections in the USA resist at least one of the main antimicrobial agents that are typically used to fight infection (Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery, 1, 895-910 (2002)).
<BR><BR> One way of tackling the growing problem of resistant bacteria is the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents.  However, until the introduction of linezolid in 2000, there had been no new class of antibiotic marketed for over 37 years. Moreover, even the development of new classes of antibiotic provides only a temporary solution, and indeed there are already reports of resistance of certain bacteria to linezolid (Lancet, 357, 1179 (2001) and Lancet, 358, 207-208 (2001)).
<BR><BR> In order to develop more long-term solutions to the problem of bacterial resistance, it is clear that alternative approaches are required.  One such alternative approach is to minimise, as much as is possible, the opportunities that bacteria are
given for developing resistance to important antibiotics.  Thus, strategies that can be adopted include limiting the use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-acute infections, as well as controlling which antibiotics are fed to animals in order to
promote growth.
<BR><BR> However, in order to tackle the problem more effectively, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the actual mechanisms by which bacteria generate resistance to antibiotic agents.  To do this requires first a consideration of how current
antibiotic agents work to kill bacteria.
<BR><BR> Antimicrobial agents target essential components of bacterial metabolism.  For example, the .beta.-lactams (e.g. penicillins and cephalosporins) inhibit cell wall synthesis, whereas other agents inhibit a diverse range of targets, such as DNA
gyrase (quinolones) and protein synthesis (e.g. macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and oxazolidinones).  The range of organisms against which the antimicrobial agents are effective varies, depending upon which organisms are heavily reliant upon
the metabolic step(s) that is/are inhibited.  Further, the effect upon bacteria can vary from a mere inhibition of growth (i.e. a bacteriostatic effect, as seen with agents such as the tetracyclines) to full killing (i.e. a bactericidal effect, as seen,
e.g. with penicillin).
<BR><BR> Bacteria have been growing on Earth for more than 3 billion years and, in that time, have needed to respond to vast numbers of environmental stresses.  It is therefore perhaps not surprising that bacteria have developed a seemingly inexhaustible
variety of mechanisms by which they can respond to the metabolic stresses imposed upon them by antibiotic agents.  Indeed, mechanisms by which the bacteria can generate resistance include strategies as diverse as inactivation of the drug, modification of
the site of action, modification of the permeability of the cell wall, overproduction of the target enzyme and bypass of the inhibited steps.  Nevertheless, the rate of resistance emerges to a particular agent has been observed to vary widely, depending
upon factors such as the agent's mechanism of action, whether the agent's mode of killing is time- or concentration-dependent, the potency against the population of bacteria and the magnitude and duration of the available serum concentration.
<BR><BR> It has been proposed (Science, 264, 388-393 (1994)) that agents that target single enzymes (e.g. rifampicin) are the most prone to the development of resistance.  Further, the longer that suboptimal levels of antimicrobial agent are in contact
with the bacteria, the more likely the emergence of resistance.
<BR><BR> Moreover, it is now known that many microbial infections include sub-populations of bacteria that are phenotypically resistant to antimicrobials (J. Antimicrob.  Chemother., 4, 395-404 (1988); J. Med.  Microbiol., 38, 197-202 (1993); J.
Bacteriol., 182, 1794-1801 (2000); ibid.  182, 6358-6365 (2000); ibid.  183, 6746-6751 (2001); FEMS Microbiol.  Lett., 202, 59-65 (2001); and Trends in Microbiology, 13, 34-40 (2005)).  There appear to be several types of such phenotypically resistant
bacteria, including persisters, stationary-phase bacteria, as well as those in the depths of biofilms.  However, each of these types is characterised by its low rate of growth compared to log-phase bacteria under the same conditions.  Nutritional
starvation and high cell densities are also common characteristics of such bacteria.
<BR><BR> Although resistant to antimicrobial agents in their slow-growing state, phenotypically resistant bacteria differ from those that are genotypically resistant in that they regain their susceptibility to antimicrobials when they return to a
fast-growing state (e.g. when nutrients become more readily available to them).
<BR><BR> The presence of phenotypically resistant bacteria in an infection leads to the need for prolonged courses of antimicrobial agents, comprising multiple doses.  This is because the resistant, slowly multiplying bacteria provide a pool of "latent"
organisms that can convert to a fast-growing state when the conditions allow (thereby effectively re-initiating the infection).  Multiple doses over time deal with this issue by gradually killing off the "latent" bacteria that convert to "active" form.
<BR><BR> However, dealing with "latent" bacteria by administering prolonged courses of antimicrobials poses its own problems.  That is, prolonged exposure of bacteria to suboptimal concentrations of antimicrobial agent can lead to the emergence of
genotypically resistant bacteria, which can then multiply rapidly in the presence of even high concentrations of the antimicrobial.
<BR><BR> Long courses of antimicrobials are more likely to encourage the emergence of genotypic resistance than shorter courses on the grounds that non-multiplying bacterial will tend to survive and, interestingly, probably have an enhanced ability to
mutate to resistance (Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 92, 11736-11740 (1995); J. Bacteriol., 179, 6688-6691 (1997); and Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother., 44, 1771-1777 (2000)).
<BR><BR> In the light of the above, a new approach to combating the problem of bacterial resistance might be to select and develop antimicrobial agents on the basis of their ability to kill "latent" microorganisms.  The production of such agents would
allow, amongst other things, for the shortening of chemotherapy regimes in the treatment of microbial infections, thus reducing the frequency with which genotypical resistance arises in microorganisms.
<BR><BR> Recently, there has been report of an anti-retroviral drug, zidovudine being active as an anti-microbial when combined with gentamicin.  Thus, Doleans-Jordheim A. et al., disclosed (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis.  2011 October; 30(10):1249-56)
that Zidovudine (AZT) had a bactericidal effect on some enterobacteria, yet could induce resistance in Escherichia coli.  These resistances were associated with various modifications in the thymidine kinase gene.  Furthermore, an additive or synergistic
activity between AZT and the two aminoglycoside antibiotics amikacin and gentamicin was observed against enterobacteria.
<BR><BR> International Patent Application, Publication Number WO2012032360 discloses that certain classes of biologically active compounds possess bactericidal activity.  One of these classes is vasodilators including compounds such as perhexiline
maleate, suloctidil or nisoldipine.
<BR><BR> International Patent Application published as WO2014/147405 describes the use of zidovudine in combination with a polymyxin selected from colistin and polymyxin B for treating a microbial infection.
<BR><BR> Polymyxins are antibiotic compounds with a general structure consisting of a cyclic peptide and a long hydrophobic tail.  They are known to disrupt the structure of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids, and
polymyxins B and E are typically used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections.  Polymyxin E is otherwise known as "Colistin", and is commercially available in Europe under the trade name Colomycin.RTM.  in tablet form.  Colomycin.RTM. 
tablets include the sulphate salt of colistin and are indicated for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections caused by sensitive Gram negative organisms, as well as for bowel preparation.  Polymyxin B is commercially available in Europe under the
trade name Maxitrol.RTM.  in the form of eye drops.  Maxitrol.RTM.  eye drops include polymyxin B in form of the sulphate salt, and are indicated for the short term treatment of steroid responsive conditions of the eye when prophylactic antibiotic
treatment is also required, after excluding the presence of fungal and viral disease.
<BR><BR> Given the importance of antimicrobial agents such as polymyxins in the fight against bacterial infection, the identification of further agents capable of enhancing their anti-bacterial activity addresses an important need.
<BR><BR>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention is thus based on the unexpected finding that the combinations and in particular the combination of suloctidil and colistin exhibit synergistic antimicrobial activity against log phase (i.e. multiplying) and/or clinically
latent microorganisms, i.e. greater than the expected additive effect of each agent at the stated dosage level.  The surprising biological activity of the combinations of the present invention offers the opportunity to shorten chemotherapy regimens and
may result in a reduction in the emergence of microbial resistance associated with the use of such combinations.
<BR><BR> Synergy in the context of antimicrobial drugs is measured in a number of ways that conform to the generally accepted opinion that "synergy is an effect greater than additive".  One of the ways to assess whether synergy has been observed is to
use the "chequerboard" technique.  This is a well-accepted method that leads to the generation of a value called the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI).  Orhan et al J. Clin. Microbiol.  2005, 43(1):140 describes the chequerboard method and
analysis in the paragraph bridging pages 140-141, and explains that the FICI value is a ratio of the sum of the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) level of each individual component alone and in the mixture.  The combination is considered synergistic
when the .SIGMA.FIC is &lt;0.5, indifferent when the .SIGMA.FIC is &gt;0.5 to &lt;4.0, and antagonistic when the .SIGMA.FIC is &gt;4.0.
<BR><BR> Another accepted test for ascertaining the presence or absence of synergy is to use time-kill methods where the dynamic effect of a drug combination is compared to each drug alone when assessing the effect on bacterial log or stationary-growth
over time.  Again, the possible results are for synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR> the use of dichlorophen for the treatment of a microbial infection in combination with colistin;
<BR><BR> the use of saccharin for the treatment of a microbial infection in combination with colistin; and
<BR><BR> the use of piroxicam for the treatment of a microbial infection in combination with colistin.
<BR><BR> Colistin can also be included in the above combinations in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative as defined herein, e.g. as a salt such as colistin sulphate.
<BR><BR> As described below, the combinations of the present invention have been demonstrated to be particularly effective against drug-resistant bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, opening the way for said combinations to be administered both
to drug-resistant strains and in said strains before drug-resistance is built up, i.e. as a first line treatment.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "in combination with" covers both separate and sequential administration of the compound and the polymyxin.  When the compound and polymyxin are administered sequentially, either the compound or the polymyxin may be
administered first.  When administration is simultaneous, the compound and polymyxin may be administered either in the same or a different pharmaceutical composition.  Adjunctive therapy, i.e. where one agent is used as a primary treatment and the other
agent is used to assist that primary treatment, is also an embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR> The combinations of the present invention may be used to treat microbial infections.  In particular they may be used to kill multiplying and/or clinically latent microorganisms associated with microbial infections.  References herein to the
treatment of a microbial infection therefore include killing multiplying and/or clinically latent microorganisms associated with such infections.  Preferably, the combinations of the present invention are used to kill clinically latent microorganisms
associated with microbial infections.
<BR><BR> As used herein, "kill" means a loss of viability as assessed by a lack of metabolic activity.
<BR><BR> As used herein, "clinically latent microorganism" means a microorganism that is metabolically active but has a growth rate that is below the threshold of infectious disease expression.  The threshold of infectious disease expression refers to
the growth rate threshold below which symptoms of infectious disease in a host are absent.
<BR><BR> The metabolic activity of clinically latent microorganisms can be determined by several methods known to those skilled in the art; for example, by measuring mRNA levels in the microorganisms or by determining their rate of uridine uptake.  In
this respect, clinically latent microorganisms, when compared to microorganisms under logarithmic growth conditions (in vitro or in vivo), possess reduced but still significant levels of: (I) mRNA (e.g. from 0.0001 to 50%, such as from 1 to 30, 5 to 25
or 10 to 20%, of the level of mRNA); and/or (II) uridine (e.g. [.sup.3H]uridine) uptake (e.g. from 0.0005 to 50%, such as from 1 to 40, 15 to 35 or 20 to 30% of the level of [.sup.3H]uridine uptake).
<BR><BR> Clinically latent microorganisms typically possess a number of identifiable characteristics.  For example, they may be viable but non-culturable; i.e. they cannot typically be detected by standard culture techniques, but are detectable and
quantifiable by techniques such as broth dilution counting, microscopy, or molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction.  In addition, clinically latent microorganisms are phenotypically tolerant, and as such are sensitive (in log phase) to the
biostatic effects of conventional antimicrobial agents (i.e. microorganisms for which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a conventional antimicrobial is substantially unchanged); but possess drastically decreased susceptibility to drug-induced
killing (e.g. microorganisms for which, with any given conventional antimicrobial agent, the ratio of minimum microbiocidal concentration (e.g. minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC) to MIC is 10 or more).
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "microorganisms" means fungi and bacteria.  References herein to "microbial", "antimicrobial" and "antimicrobially" shall be interpreted accordingly.  For example, the term "microbial" means fungal or bacterial, and
"microbial infection" means any fungal or bacterial infection.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment of the invention, one or more of the aforementioned combinations is used to treat a bacterial infection in particular, the combinations may be used to kill clinically latent microorganisms associated with a bacterial infection. As used herein, the term "bacteria" (and derivatives thereof, such as "microbial infection") includes, but is not limited to, references to organisms (or infections due to organisms) of the following classes and specific types:

<BR><BR> Preferably, the bacterial infections treated by the combinations described herein are gram-negative infections.
<BR><BR> Particular bacteria that may be treated using a combination of the invention include Gram negative bacteria:
<BR><BR> Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella (e.g. Klebs.  pneumoniae and Klebs.  oxytoca) and Proteus (e.g. Pr.  mirabilis, Pr.  rettgeri and Pr.  vulgaris);
<BR><BR> Haemophilis influenzae;
<BR><BR> Mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
<BR><BR> Preferably, the bacterium is Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella (e.g. Klebs.  pneumoniae and Klebs.  oxytoca) and Proteus (e.g. Pr.  mirabilis, Pr.  rettgeri and Pr.  vulgaris).  The combination of the present invention is
particularly beneficial in treating (multi)-drug-resistant ((M)DR) bacteria.  With respect to Enterobacteriaceae, drug resistance most often builds up to carbapenemase i.e. carbapenemase-resistant strains and "extended spectrum .beta.-lactamase" (ESBL)
strains for example New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) resistant Klebs.  Pneumonia.
<BR><BR> More preferably the bacterium is Escherichia coli or Klebsiella (e.g. Klebs.  pneumoniae).
<BR><BR> It should be kept in mind that although a combination such as that claimed may initially be demonstrated to be functional in treating (M)DR strains, they can then be used in treating non-resistant strains.  This is especially valuable in the
context of the presently claimed combination where the primary therapy for Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella (e.g. Klebs.  pneumoniae and Klebs.  oxytoca) and Proteus (e.g. Pr.  mirabilis, Pr.  rettgeri and Pr.  vulgaris) are
anti-microbial drugs that are expensive due to prevailing patent protection.  The replacement of such "ethical" drugs by a combination of "generic" antibiotics is thought to be beneficial from a therapeutic perspective as well as financial/economic
perspective in times where governments are seeking to reduce the cost of healthcare.
<BR><BR> The combinations of the present invention may be used to treat infections associated with any of the above-mentioned bacterial organisms, and in particular they may be used for killing multiplying and/or clinically latent microorganisms
associated with such an infection.

Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.  In particular, the combination in kidney stone associated infections and catheter-associated infections arising from any of the bacteria described.
<BR><BR> It will be appreciated that references herein to "treatment" extend to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms.
<BR><BR> As used herein the term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" means:
<BR><BR> (a) pharmaceutically acceptable salts; and/or
<BR><BR> (b) solvates (including hydrates).
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates (including hydrates) are also understood to include polymorphs such as pseudopolymorphs, packing polymorphs and conformational polymorphs.
<BR><BR> A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977) as well as P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, editors, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, Weinheim/Zurich:
Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002.  Suitable acid addition salts include carboxylate salts (e.g. formate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, propionate, isobutyrate, heptanoate, decanoate, caprate, caprylate, stearate, acrylate, caproate, propiolate, ascorbate, citrate,
glucuronate, glutamate, glycolate, .alpha.-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, tartrate, phenylacetate, mandelate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, o-acetoxybenzoate,
salicylate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, cinnamate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, malate, maleate, hydroxymaleate, hippurate, phthalate or terephthalate salts), halide salts (e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide salts), sulfonate
salts (e.g. benzenesulfonate, methyl-, bromo- or chloro-benzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, hydroxyethanesulfonate, 1- or 2-naphthalene-sulfonate or 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate salts) or sulfate,
pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate or nitrate salts, and the like.
<BR><BR> The antibacterial agent is preferably a polymyxin such as colistin and/or polymyxin B or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.  Particularly preferred is colistin or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.  A preferred salt
of colistin is the sulfate salt thereof, i.e. polymyxin B sulfate.  A preferred salt of polymyxin E is the sulfate salt thereof, i.e. polymyxin E sulfate.
<BR><BR> Several of the compounds included in the combinations of the present invention including suloctidil, polymyxin B, colistin sulfate, polymyxin E sulfate and colistin are commercially available, for example from Sigma Aldrich Limited.  Others may
be prepared using conventional methods known in the art.
<BR><BR> The invention further includes suloctidil in prodrug form, i.e. in the form of a covalently bonded compound which releases the active suloctidil in vivo.  Suloctidil has the following formula:
<BR><BR> ##STR00001##
<BR><BR> Such prodrugs are generally the active ingredient, i.e. suloctidil, wherein one or more appropriate groups (typically the OH or NH group) have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian
subject.  Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo.  Examples of such modifications
to suloctidil include 1-N-substituted (acyloxy)-alkyl carbamate compounds and esters.  With an ester prodrug the reversion to suloctidil may be carried out by an esterase.
<BR><BR> Esters are typically formed using organic acids.  Organic acids that may be used include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid;
with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with amino acids,
for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C.sub.1-C.sub.4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic
acid.  In some cases it may be desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkyl esters).
<BR><BR> In one embodiment the prodrug of suloctidil is a compound of formula (1):
<BR><BR> ##STR00002## wherein: R is H or COR.sup.a where R.sup.a is hydrogen, an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally substituted alkenyl group, an optionally substituted alkynyl group, an optionally substituted aryl group, an optionally

<BR><BR> R.sup.a is preferably selected from C.sub.1-C.sub.8 alkyl or C.sub.1-C.sub.4 alkyl, each optionally substituted with halo, OH, OR.sup.b, or NHSO.sub.2R.sup.b wherein R.sup.b is C.sub.1-4 alkyl; or C.sub.3-C.sub.10cycloalkyl, 4-10 membered
heterocyclyl, C.sub.6-C.sub.10aryl, arylalkyl, 5-10 membered heteroaryl or heteroarylalkyl, each optionally substituted with C.sub.1-4 alkyl, C.sub.1-4 hydroxyalkyl, C.sub.1-4 haloalkoxy, OH, OR.sup.b, or NHSO.sub.2R.sup.b wherein R.sup.b is C.sub.1-4
alkyl.

Dormicidal Concentration ("MDC") for a test compound.  A suitable compound screening method against clinically latent microorganisms is described in WO2000028074, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference as if the publication was
specifically and fully set forth herein.
<BR><BR> Compounds for use according to the invention may be administered as the raw material but the active ingredients are preferably provided in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.
<BR><BR> The active ingredients may be used either as separate formulations or as a single combined formulation.  When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the
other components of the formulation.
<BR><BR> Formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous e.g. by injection or by depot tablet, intradermal, intrathecal, intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous), rectal and topical (including dermal,
buccal and sublingual) or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation administration.  The most suitable route of administration may depend upon the condition and disorder of the patient.  Preferably, the compositions of the
invention are formulated for oral or topical administration.  In a preferred embodiment, the composition is a cream or an ointment adapted for nasal administration, in particular for delivery to the anterior nares.
<BR><BR> The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy e.g. as described in "Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy", Lippincott Williams and
Wilkins, 21.sup.st Edition, (2005).  Suitable methods include the step of bringing into association to active ingredients with a carrier which constitutes one or more excipients.  In general, formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing
into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.  It will be appreciated that when the two active ingredients are administered
independently, each may be administered by a different means.
<BR><BR> When formulated with excipients, the active ingredients may be present in a concentration from 0.1 to 99.5% (such as from 0.5 to 95%) by weight of the total mixture; conveniently from 30 to 95% for tablets and capsules and 0.01 to 50% (such as
from 3 to 50%) for liquid preparations.
<BR><BR> Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in particular for pediatric administration), each containing a predetermined amount of active
ingredient; as powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or water-in-oil liquid emulsion.  The active ingredients may also be presented a bolus, electuary or paste.
<BR><BR> A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more excipients.  Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules,
optionally mixed with other conventional excipients such as binding agents (e.g. syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and/or hydroxymethyl cellulose), fillers (e.g. lactose, sugar, microcrystalline
cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate and/or sorbitol), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol and/or silica), disintegrants (e.g. potato starch, croscarmellose sodium and/or sodium starch glycolate) and wetting
agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate).  Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient with an inert liquid diluent.  The tablets may be optionally coated or scored and may be formulated so as to
provide controlled release (e.g. delayed, sustained, or pulsed release, or a combination of immediate release and controlled release) of the active ingredients.
<BR><BR> Alternatively, the active ingredients may be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs.  Formulations containing the active ingredients may also be presented as a dry
product for constitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use.  Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxymethyl
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel and/or hydrogenated edible fats), emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate and/or acacia), non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. edible oils, such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil,
oily esters, propylene glycol and/or ethyl alcohol), and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates and/or sorbic acid).
<BR><BR> Topical compositions, which are useful for treating disorders of the skin or of membranes accessible by digitation (such as membrane of the mouth, vagina, cervix, anus and rectum), include creams, ointments, lotions, sprays, gels and sterile
aqueous solutions or suspensions.  As such, topical compositions include those in which the active ingredients are dissolved or dispersed in a dermatological vehicle known in the art (e.g. aqueous or non-aqueous gels, ointments, water-in-oil or
oil-in-water emulsions).  Constituents of such vehicles may comprise water, aqueous buffer solutions, non-aqueous solvents (such as ethanol, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monolaurate,
glycofurol or glycerol), oils (e.g. a mineral oil such as a liquid paraffin, natural or synthetic triglycerides such as Miglyol.TM., or silicone oils such as dimethicone).  Depending, inter alia, upon the nature of the formulation as well as its intended
use and site of application, the dermatological vehicle employed may contain one or more components selected from the following list: a solubilising agent or solvent (e.g. a .beta.-cyclodextrin, such as hydroxypropyl .beta.-cyclodextrin, or an alcohol or
polyol such as ethanol, propylene glycol or glycerol); a thickening agent (e.g. hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose or carbomer); a gelling agent (e.g. a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer); a preservative
(e.g. benzyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorbutol, a benzoate, potassium sorbate or EDTA or salt thereof); and pH buffering agent(s) (e.g. a mixture of dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate salts, or a mixture of citric acid
and a hydrogen phosphate salt).  Topical formulations may also be formulated as a transdermal patch.
<BR><BR> Methods of producing topical pharmaceutical compositions such as creams, ointments, lotions, sprays and sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions are well known in the art.  Suitable methods of preparing topical pharmaceutical compositions are
described, e.g. in WO9510999, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,974,585, WO2006048747, as well as in documents cited in any of these references.
<BR><BR> Topical pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be used to treat a variety of skin or membrane disorders, such as infections of the skin or membranes (e.g. infections of nasal membranes, axilla, groin, perineum,
rectum, dermatitic skin, skin ulcers, and sites of insertion of medical equipment such as i.v.  needles, catheters and tracheostomy or feeding tubes) with any of the bacteria, fungi described above, (e.g. any of the Staphylococci, Streptococci,
Mycobacteria or Pseudomonas organisms mentioned hereinbefore, such as S. aureus (e.g. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA))).
<BR><BR> Particular bacterial conditions that may be treated by topical pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also include the skin- and membrane-related conditions disclosed hereinbefore, as well as: acne vulgaris; rosacea (including
erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea and ocular rosacea); erysipelas; erythrasma; ecthyma; ecthyma gangrenosum; impetigo; paronychia; cellulitis; folliculitis (including hot tub folliculitis); furunculosis;
carbunculosis; staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome; surgical scarlet fever; streptococcal peri-anal disease; streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; pitted keratolysis; trichomycosis axillaris; pyoderma; external canal ear infections; green nail syndrome;
spirochetes; necrotizing fasciitis; Mycobacterial skin infections (such as lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, warty tuberculosis, tuberculides, erythema nodosum, erythema induratum, cutaneous manifestations of tuberculoid leprosy or lepromatous leprosy,
erythema nodosum leprosum, cutaneous M. kansasii, M. malmoense, M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gordonae, M. haemophilum, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. chelonae (including M. abscessus) or M. fortuitum infections, swimming pool (or fish tank) granuloma,
lymphadenitis and Buruli ulcer (Bairnsdale ulcer, Searles' ulcer, Kakerifu ulcer or Toro ulcer)); as well as infected eczma, burns, abrasions and skin wounds.
<BR><BR> Compositions for use according to the invention may be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredients.  The pack may, e.g. comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a
blister pack.  Where the compositions are intended for administration as two separate compositions these may be presented in the form of a twin pack.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prescribed to the patient in "patient packs" containing the whole course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack.  Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a
pharmacist divides a patients' supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in traditional prescriptions.  The inclusion of the package insert
has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.
<BR><BR> Suitable dosages and formulations for the administration of colistin are described in the product label for Colomycin.RTM.  which can be found at http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/6301/SPC/Colomycin+Tablets/dosag- es and formulations for
the administration of caffeic acid (hydroxycinnamic acid), thymol, aspirin, benzydamine hydrochloride, diclofenac sodium, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, trifluoperazine hydrochloride, chlorprothixene hydrochloride, triflupromazine hydrochloride,
suloctidil, thioridazine hydrochloride, dichlorophen, saccharin and piroxicam may be obtained from conventional sources such as www.medicine.org.uk, http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm, www.rxlist.com and/or www.drugs.com. 
These sources disclose the therapeutic, safe doses for each of these drugs.  When used in combination in accordance with the present invention, the dosage of said drug may be decreased from that known.
<BR><BR> The administration of the combination of the invention by means of a single patient pack, or patients packs of each composition, including a package insert directing the patient to the correct use of the invention is a desirable feature of this
invention.
<BR><BR> According to a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a patient pack comprising at least one active ingredient of the combination according to the invention and an information insert containing directions on the use of the
combination of the invention.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a double pack comprising in association for separate administration, an antimicrobial agent, preferably having biological activity against clinically latent microorganisms, and one or
more of the compounds disclosed herein preferably having biological activity against clinically latent microorganisms.
<BR><BR> According to a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a patient pack comprising at least one active ingredient of the combinations according to the invention, i.e. at least one of suloctidil or a pharmaceutically
acceptable derivative or prodrug thereof and a polymyxin selected from polymyxin E and polymyxin B or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, and an information insert containing directions on the use of the combination.
<BR><BR> The amount of active ingredients required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or
veterinarian.  In general however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02 to 5000 mg per day, preferably 1 to 1500 mg per day.  The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses
administered at appropriate intervals, e.g. as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.
<BR><BR> Biological Tests
<BR><BR> Test procedures that may be employed to determine the biological (e.g. bactericidal or antimicrobial) activity of the active ingredients include those known to persons skilled in the art for determining: (a) bactericidal activity against
clinically latent bacteria; and (b) antimicrobial activity against log phase bacteria.
<BR><BR> In relation to (a) above, methods for determining activity against clinically latent bacteria include a determination, under conditions known to those skilled in the art (such as those described in Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery 1, 895-910
(2002), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference), of Minimum Stationary-cidal Concentration ("MSC") or Minimum Dormicidal Concentration ("MDC") for a test compound.
<BR><BR> By way of example, WO2000028074 describes a suitable method of screening compounds to determine their ability to kill clinically latent microorganisms.  A typical method may include the following steps: (1) growing a bacterial culture to
stationery phase; (2) treating the stationery phase culture with one or more antimicrobial agents at a concentration and or time sufficient to kill growing bacteria, thereby selecting a phenotypically resistant sub-population; (3) incubating a sample of
the phenotypically resistant subpopulation with one or more test compounds or agents; and (4) assessing any antimicrobial effects against the phenotypically resistant subpopulation.
<BR><BR> According to this method, the phenotypically resistant sub-population may be seen as representative of clinically latent bacteria which remain metabolically active in vivo and which can result in relapse or onset of disease.
<BR><BR> In relation to (b) above, methods for determining activity against log phase bacteria include a determination, under standard conditions (i.e. conditions known to those skilled in the art, such as those described in WO 2005014585, the
disclosures of which document are hereby incorporated by reference), of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ("MIC") or Minimum Bactericidal Concentration ("MBC") for a test compound.  Specific examples of such methods are described below.

<BR><BR> In Vitro Synergy Effect of Suloctidil in Combination with Colistin Against Log Phase NDM-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae
<BR><BR> The synergistic effect of suloctidil in combination with colistin was tested against log phase NDM-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae using time-kill methods over a period of 24 hours.
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Bacterial strain used: NCTC 13443 strain of NDM-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae
<BR><BR> Growth of bacteria: Log phase growth of the bacteria was carried out according to methods known in the art.
<BR><BR> Compounds and Preparation:
<BR><BR> (i) Suloctidil was obtained from a commercial source and dissolved in DMSO to make a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml.
<BR><BR> (ii) Colistin was obtained from a commercial source at a concentration of 20 mg/ml.
<BR><BR> Both suloctidil and colistin were then added to 96 well plates either alone or in the combinations shown below in Table 1.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Agent (Concentration) Number/Letter Combination Combination Colistin (32 .mu.g/ml) 1 1&A 1&C Colistin (16 .mu.g/ml) 2 2&A 2&C Colistin (8 .mu.g/ml) 3 3&A 3&C Colistin (4 .mu.g/ml) 4 4&A 4&C Suloctidil (32 .mu.g/ml) A 1&B

<BR><BR> The overnight culture was diluted with nutrient broth (Oxoid) to 10.sup.7 CFU/ml and 280 .mu.l and 290 .mu.l of the culture was added to each combination well and single agent well, respectively, to make a final concentration of 300 .mu.l. 
Incubation of the compounds with the bacterial suspension was carried out for 24 hours.  At 0, 2, 4, 7 and 25 hours, CFU counts were performed to measure the kill effects of the drug combination.
<BR><BR> Results
<BR><BR> The time-kill curves are shown in FIGS. 18 to 27, where suloctidil is referenced as "93".
<BR><BR> Summary and Conclusion 1.  It can be seen from FIGS. 18 to 27 that suloctidil (i.e. "93") had no antimicrobial effect against log phase NDM-1 K. pneumoniae when used alone at concentrations of 32, 16, 8 and 4 .mu.g/ml.  2.  It can be seen from
FIGS. 20, 21, 24, 25 and 27 that colistin also had no antimicrobial effect against log phase NDM-1 K. pneumoniae when used alone at concentrations of 8 and 4 .mu.g/ml.  3.  FIGS. 18, 19, 22, 23 and 26 then demonstrate that colistin had an antimicrobial
effect against log phase NDM-1 K. pneumoniae at concentrations of 32 and 16 .mu.g/ml, but that this effect was not long term.  4.  FIG. 19 for example shows that colistin (16 .mu.g/ml) caused complete kill after 7 hours and bacteria re-growth after 25
hours.  5.  In each of FIGS. 18 to 27, it can, however, be seen that there was a significant synergistic effect against log phase NDM-1 K. pneumoniae when suloctidil and colistin were used in combination.  This synergistic effect resulted in both a
faster and longer term kill of the bacteria.
