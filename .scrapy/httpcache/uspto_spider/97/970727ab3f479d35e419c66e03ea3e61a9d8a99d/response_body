<BR><BR>The present invention relates to novel galenic forms of verapamil, their manufacture and medicines containing said novel galenic forms.
<BR><BR>Verapamil or 5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyl)methyl-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl valeronitrile of formula I is known since more than 20 years and the synthesis thereof is described in Belgian Pat.  No. 615,816 corresponding to U.S.  Pat.  No.
3,261,859, to Dengel.  ##STR1##
<BR><BR>Verapamil chlorhydrate is used in medicine in view of its outsetting properties as the calcium intracellular penetration antagonist.  This characteristic makes from it an interesting medicine for the treatment of angor pectoris when the crisis or
attack is bound to a coronary spasm and when undesirable effects of beta-adrenolytic products such as propranolol, timolol, atenolol and pindolol, are to be feared for.  Said substance is also useful in the treatment of hypertension or too high blood
pressure and of troubles of the cardiac rhythm.
<BR><BR>It is known from the skilled men that the pharmacological action of verapamil is proportional to its plasmatic concentration (Br.  J. Clin. Pharmac.  (1981), 12, 397-400) and that the optimum therapeutic zone is comprised between 100 ng/ml and
400 ng/ml of plasma.
<BR><BR>The major disadvantage of a treatment based upon verapamil is due to its very short plasmatic half-life period (2 to 4 hours), which requires several daily administrations spaced of 6 hours only.  Such near administration times render the
treatment very annoying or even impossible to be carried out, particularly by night.  Moreover, after each administration of a galenic form of verapamil with immediate release, i.e. generally four times per day, a succession of fast increasing and
decreasing plasmatic ratios are established.  The organism and namely the targed-organ, more particularly the heart, are alternatively subjected to overdoses and to underdoses of medicine.
<BR><BR>In order to palliate these drawbacks, a first galenic form with sustained-release of verapamil, called "Isoptine Retard.RTM." and presented as a tablet constituted of an hydrophilic matrix, was put onto the market.  Although said
sustained-release galenic form allows to eliminate concentration peaks, the bioavailability of verapamil from this galenic form is extremely low, such as will be told hereinafter, so that said form does not permit to achieve practically the plasmatic
therapeutic ratios and, consequently, renders difficult the obtention of a satisfying clinical effect.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to novel galenic forms of verapamil with sustained-release of said active substance, said novel galenic forms showing an excellent bioavailability, while avoiding the plasmatic concentration peaks, so that it is now
possible not only to maintain the verapamil plasmatic concentrations in the actually effective range, but also to simplify dosage, since said novel forms do not necessitate more than one or two daily administrations of the medicine, depending on the
patient's metabolism.
<BR><BR>According to the present invention, said novel galenic forms with verapamil sustained-release are substantially characterized by the fact that they are constituted of microgranules containing a pharmacologically acceptable verapamil addition salt
with an acid, such as verapamil chlorhydrate, as an active substance, associated to at least a wetting agent, said microgranules being coated with a microporous membrane constituted of at least a synthetic polymer associated to at least a
pharmacologically acceptable adjuvant.
<BR><BR>According to another feature of the present invention, the microporous membrane whereof the verapamil salt containing microgranules are coated is constituted of at least one synthetic polymer associated to at least one adjuvant selected from
plastifying agents, pigments, fillers, wetting agents, lubrifying agents or lubricants, antistatic and antifoaming agents . <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>FIGS. 1-5 provide the verapamil plasmatic concentrations as a function of time. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

<BR><BR>The weight of the microporous membrane may be 2 to 35%, preferably 5 to 22%, of the weight of said microgranules.  These microgranules may contain verapamil chlorhydrate in an amount of 20 to 95% by weight, preferably 30 to 85% by weight.
<BR><BR>The microporous membrane may contain 5 to 95% and, preferably, 30 to 90% of polymers or polymer mixture.
<BR><BR>The invention relates also to a medicine containing verapamil as a sustained-release ingredient, said medicine being constituted of microgranules containing verapamil, preferably in the form of its chlorhydrate and at least a wetting agent,
coated with at least one polymer-based microporous membrane, said coated microgranules being contained in capsules, little bags or dosage dispensers.
<BR><BR>The present invention relates also to a process for obtaining novel forms of verapamil with sustained- and/or delayed-release in the gastro-intestinal tractus, said process comprising previously preparing microgranules and coating same with a
microporous membrane.
<BR><BR>Several known techniques may be used for obtaining microgranules containing verapamil chlorhydrate.  A first technique consists in mixing verapamil chlorhydrate with the wetting agent(s) in a melted or finely divided form, or in solution, in the
presence of a solvent, such as water or an hydroalcoholic mixture, so as to obtain an extrudable paste or plastic mass.
<BR><BR>Said paste is thereafter extruded in an extruder and the extruded product is rendered spherical.  Preferably, an extruder is used with a die having a diameter comprised between 0.1 mm and 3 mm, preferably between 0.5 mm and 2 mm.  Several
extruder types are usable, for example the extruder of ALEXANDERWERK (RFA) or the apparatus called X-truder of FUJI-PAUDAL (Japan).  For obtaining microspheres or microgranules from the extruded product provided in the form of little cylinders, an
apparatus called "spheronizer" of the CALEVA (Great-Britain) or MARUMERIZER (FUJIU-PAUDAL Japan) type is used.
<BR><BR>Another technique for obtaining microgranules consists in spraying and/or dusting cores obtained through agglomeration of verapamil chlorhydrate contingently mixed to at least a wetting agent, with an organic or aqueous dispersion or solution of
at least one wetting agent, for example in a known pilling turbine or in a granulating apparatus, such as the CF granulator system of FREUND INDUSTRIAL CO.  (Japan), or in a known planet granulator.
<BR><BR>The obtained microgranules are dried by any means, for example in an oven or by means of a gas in a fluidized bed.
<BR><BR>Finally, said microgranules are calibrated to the necessary diameter by passage through appropriate screens.
<BR><BR>A pasty or plastic mixture, appropriate to be granulated by means of anyone of the above described techniques, may contain the following weight proportions of verapamil chlorhydrate, wetting agents and carriers or excipients:
<BR><BR>20 to 90% verapamil chlorhydrate;
<BR><BR>15 to 30% sucroesters WE 15 (wetting agent);
<BR><BR>8 to 15% Avicel PH 101 (microcrystalline cellulose of FMC, U.S.A.);
<BR><BR>2 to 25% Avicel CL 611 (microcrystalline cellulose of FMC, U.S.A.);
<BR><BR>2 to 35% sucrose (wetting agent);
<BR><BR>2 to 10% Methocel E 5 (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose of DOW, U.S.A.);
<BR><BR>1 to 15% polyvinylpyrrolidone and
<BR><BR>5 to 30% distilled water.
<BR><BR>Said microporous membrane may be applied onto said microgranules by pulverizing an hydroalcoholic or aqueous dispersion of at least one of the above-named polymers and at least one of the above-mentioned adjuvants onto said microgranules.  This
pulverization may be carried out by spray-gunning or by pulverizing the above-named dispersion into a turbine or a fluidized bed.
<BR><BR>According an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, said microporous membrane may be obtained, starting from an aqueous dispersion which contains by weight:
<BR><BR>10 to 45% Eudragit E30D (polymer);
<BR><BR>5 to 70% Eudragit L30D (polymer);
<BR><BR>1 to 25% talc (lubricant);
<BR><BR>1 to 15% polyvinylpyrrolidone (plastifying agent);
<BR><BR>0.05 to 4% colloidal aluminium oxide (antifoaming agent), or
<BR><BR>0.01 to 2% silicone oil (antifoaming agent);
<BR><BR>10 to 70% water (carrier).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>The whole of the features and advantages of the invention will be better understood by the skilled men, referring to the following disclosure of particular nonlimitative embodiments given by way of examples of the novel verapamil galenic form,
its manufacturing process and its therapeutic applications, especially in relation with pharmacocinetic controls using said novel galenic form.
<BR><BR>Examples of preparation of the new galenic form EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>a. Manufacture of microgranules
<BR><BR>The following ingredients were used:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ Verapamil HCl 325 g  Sucrose 125 g  Avicel PH 101 25 g  Methocel E5 20 g  Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 5 g  500 g  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>After introducing the powders into a planet mixer and granulating same through the addition of 75 g of distilled water, the obtained plastic mass was extruded through the 1 mm-diameter holes of a cylindrical die of an extruder (Alexanderwerk). 
The obtained little cylinders were thereafter made spherical by spheronization into a Marumerizer type apparatus.  After drying during 24 h into a ventilated oven brought to 50.degree.  C. the fraction of microgranules the diameter of which is comprised
between 0.7 mm and 1.4 mm was recovered by screening through appropriate screens.  437 g of microgranules (yield: 87%) were so obtained.
<BR><BR>b. Coating of microgranules
<BR><BR>Onto 400 g of microgranules, the size of which is comprised between 0.7 and 1.4 mm, was gun-sprayed into a Strea I type Aeromatic fIuidized bed apparatus, 176 g of the following dispersion:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ magnesium stearate 7.50 g  titanium bioxide 6.25 g  polyvinylpyrrolidone 6.25 g  Tween 20 0.20 g  verapamil chlorhydrate 6.25 g  water 145.25 g  Eudragit E30D 328.30 g  500.00g 
______________________________________ Duration of the gunspraying: 45 minutes  Drying into the oven at 50.degree. C. during 24 hours.
<BR><BR>It must be emphasized that the verapamil chlorhydrate contained in the membrane applied onto the microgranules is intended to be fastly released after the administration of the pharmaceutical composition.
<BR><BR>c. Pharmaceutical compositions
<BR><BR>After screening and control of the content of the microgranules in verapamil chlorhydrate and after having adjusted said content to the desired value through addition of neutral microgranules, such as sucrose microgranules, the mixture was
introduced into hard gelatine capsules in order to obtain the desired verapamil unit dosage.
<BR><BR>d. Measures of the verapamil release-speed out of the microgranules
<BR><BR>In order to ascertain the quality of the verapamil sustained-release preparation, a method was used, described in "The United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) XXI", edition 1985, p. 1243-1244, under the title Dissolution Apparatus II, the dissolving
medium being constituted of a buffer of pH=5.8.  215.5 mg of microgranules of example 1 per flask were used.
<BR><BR>The following results have been obtained during said dissolution.
<BR><BR>______________________________________ % of verapamil HCl dissolved  Time .+-. SD (standard deviation)  ______________________________________ After 1 h 1.6 .+-. 0.2  After 4 h 27.0 .+-. 0.3  After 8 h 84.2 .+-. 0.5 
______________________________________
<BR><BR>The novel galenic form according to the invention hereabove described was subjected to an extensive pharmacocinetic study, compared to an immediate release form (Isoptine.RTM.) and to a delay-form actually available in the commerce (Isoptine
Retard.RTM.).
<BR><BR>Five voluntary subjects have received successively and in a random order each of the three forms at a 2 week's interval, at equivalent doses (360 mg of verapamil).  The determination of the cinetic of the verapamil plasmatic concentrations has
been carried out by means of 14 to 16 sample takings and provided the curves of the joined FIG. 1.
<BR><BR>On said FIG. 1, the dotted curve relates to the normal Isoptine, the dashed curve relates to the galenic form according to example 1 and the continuous curve relates to Delay-Isoptine.
<BR><BR>Five healthy voluntary subjects have also received the novel galenic form of verapamil according to example 1 during one week, in an amount of one dosage of 360 g of verapamil chlorhydrate every 24 hours.  The evaluation curve of the plasmatic
ratios (given in ng/ml) was obtained by means of 17 blood takings (see FIG. 2).
<BR><BR>At the end of said study, the conclusions were as follows:
<BR><BR>1.  Administration in unit dosages (FIG. 1)
<BR><BR>1.1 Bioavailability
<BR><BR>According to the values of the surfaces under the curves, plasmatic concentrations on ordinates time from 0 to 24 h on abscissa (non infinite-extrapolated values), the bioavailability of the galenic form according to example 1 appears to be
equivalent (88.5%) to that of the immediate release product, whereas the bioavailability of the Delay-Isoptine product is definitely lower, as said bioavailability achieves only 26% of that of the rapid release product.
<BR><BR>1.2 Course of the plasmatic curves
<BR><BR>Both sustained release forms give practically parallel curves the course whereof is characteristic of such a galenic preparation type.
<BR><BR>2.  Administration of repeated dosages (FIG. 2)
<BR><BR>The mean curve of the plasmatic ratios, given in ng/ml, obtained after the eighth daily oral dose of 360 mg of verapamil chlorhydrate in the galenic form of example 1, lies, practically during 24 hours (i.e. in the interval comprised between
successive doses), within an optimum therapeutic range.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>a. Manufacture of microgranules
<BR><BR>The following amounts of products, given in grams, were used:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ verapamil HCl 480  sucroester WE 15 60  Avicel 60  water for granulation  165  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>The preparation process was the same as in example 1, with the provision that a XTRUDER extruder (Fuji-Paudal) was used.  524 g of microgranules were obtained (yield: 87.33%).
<BR><BR>b. Coating of microgranules
<BR><BR>The same process as in example 1 was carried out.  Onto 500 g of microgranules were sprayed 305 g of the following aqueous dispersion (amounts given un g):
<BR><BR>______________________________________ talc 50.00  polyvinylpyrrolidone 7.50  Tween 20 0.20  distilled water 302.30  Eudragit E30D 452.50  Eudragit L30D 187.50  1000.00  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>c. Pharmaceutical form
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutical form has been obtained by working as described in example 1.
<BR><BR>d. Measure of the verapamil release of said micro granules
<BR><BR>Using the same method and analysis equipment as described in example 1, the following results were obtained:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ Time % verapamil HCl dissolved .+-. SD  ______________________________________ After 1 h 1.5 .+-. 0.1  After 4 h 29.8 .+-. 1.0  After 8 h 74.2 .+-. 0.8  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>The novel galenic form of example 2 according to the invention was subjected to an extensive pharmacocinetic study in comparison with the immediate release form (Isoptine.RTM.) and with the delay form presently available on the market (Isoptine
Retard.RTM.).
<BR><BR>Five voluntary subjects received successively each of the three forms at an interval of 2 weeks at equivalent dosages (360 mg of verapamil) and in a random order.
<BR><BR>The plasmatic ratios (given in ng/ml) for measuring the verapamil blood concentration evolution have been established by means of 14 to 16 blood takings (see joined FIG. 3).
<BR><BR>The verapamil plasmatic ratio evolution was also measured after the eighth oral dose repeated in five healthy subjects at the rate of one 360 mg dose per 24 h, calculated as verapamil chlorhydrate in the galenic form of example 2 (FIG. 4).
<BR><BR>At the end of said study, the conclusion is that: with regard to the compared bioavailabilities and the plasmatic curve courses, the conclusions given at the end of the study of example 1 are valuable for this example 2, both in the case of sole
dosages and in the case of repeated dosages.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>The study of the influence of a wetting agent in the composition of said microgranules could be carried out after having prepared a galenic form using the method and the equipment described in example 2, but substituting for the wetting agent of
example 2, namely sucroester WE 15, lactose which is an inert powder without wetting properties, the microporous membrane being quantitatively and qualitatively identical to the one of example 2.
<BR><BR>The so obtained galenic form was subjected to an extensive pharmacocinetic study compared with the form of example 2.
<BR><BR>For this purpose, five healthy voluntaries received successively each of both forms at an interval of 2 weeks at equivalent dosages (360 mg of verapamil chlorhydrate) and in a random order.  The plasmatic ratios (given in ng/ml) for the measure
of the verapamil blood concentration evolution were established by means of 14 blood takings (see joined FIG. 5).
<BR><BR>At the end of said study, the conclusions are that:
<BR><BR>1.  The bioavailability of the form without wetting agent achieves only 29.6% of the bioavailability of the form with a wetting agent of example 2.
<BR><BR>2.  Although the galenic form without wetting agent has a more rapid absorption than the form of example 2 during the two first hours, the plasmatic ratios obtained with said form without wetting agent are not sustained at all, are extremely low
and insufficient.
<BR><BR>On a clinical point of view, the characteristics of sustained or continuous and slow release of verapamil from the microgranules of the novel galenic forms according to the invention have given raise to the disclosure of the following important
advantages:
<BR><BR>Better accession of the patient to its treatment, for the reason that the number of daily medicine doses is reduced.  In general, the novel galenic form requires only solely one daily administration, whereas an equivalent treatment by means of
immediate release preparations comprises four daily doses, i.e. a dose every 6 hours.
<BR><BR>Increase of the therapeutic efficiency, on the first hand thanks to the maintaining of efficient plasmatic concentrations during the whole space of time separating two successive doses of medicine and, on the other hand, owing to the suppression
of the succession of peaks (temporarily too high plasmatic concentrations) and valleys (too low concentrations).
<BR><BR>Reduced risks and increased ease in the adjustment of the individual posology, thanks to an important reduction of the plasmatic ratio variations from one patient to the other.
<BR><BR>Consequently, it may be positively stated the novel galenic forms according to the present invention provide a useful novel medicine for treating cardiac rhythm disorders, hypertension or high blood pressure, angor pectoris or all other medical
use of verapamil through oral administration.
<BR><BR>It must be emphasized that the skilled men will be able to discover other advantages and variations of the invention, more particularly relating to the process for obtaining said microgranules and said membrane serving to control the release of
the active substance, without departing from the present invention as defined in the following claims.
