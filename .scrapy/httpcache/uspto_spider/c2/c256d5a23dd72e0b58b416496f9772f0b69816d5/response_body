<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 are a sub-class of the class of drugs known as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  The NSADs are active in reducing the prostaglandin-induced pain and swelling associated with the inflammation
process but are also active in affecting other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with the inflammation process.  Thus, use of high doses of most common NSAIDs can produce severe side effects, including life threatening ulcers, that limit
their therapeutic potential.  An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteroids, which have even more drastic side effects, especially when long term therapy is involved.
<BR><BR> Previous NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandin by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).  The discovery that there are two isoforms of the COX
enzyme, the first, COX-1, being involved with physiological functions and the second, COX-2, being induced in inflamed tissue, has given rise to a new approach.  While conventional NSAIDs block both forms of the enzyme, the identification of the
inducible COX-2 enzyme associated with inflammation has provided a viable target of inhibition which more effectively reduces inflammation and produces fewer and less drastic side effects.  Many compounds which have activity as COX-2 inhibitors have been
identified, including rofecoxib (VIOXX.RTM.), etoricoxib (ARCOXIA.TM.), celecoxib (CELEBREX.RTM.) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA.TM.), and much research continues in this area.
<BR><BR> Many patients with a chronic cyclooxygenase-2 mediated disease or condition are elderly and thus are at increased risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events, such as stroke, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, transient
ischemic attack (TIA; amaurosis fugax), reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and any similar thrombotic event in any vascular bed (splanchnic, renal, aortic, peripheral, etc.).  Moreover, there is evidence that patients with chronic inflammatory
conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis are at increased risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events.  Thus, it is desirable that such patients receive appropriate therapy to reduce their risk of such events.
<BR><BR> NO-releasing forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known in the art and are reported to have improved gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety profiles over their conventional NSAID counterparts.  Furthermore, NO-releasing forms
of selective cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are disclosed in WO 01/45703, published on Jun.  28, 2001.
<BR><BR> The present invention provides for novel nitrosated or nitrosylated prodrugs for cyxlooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors that are useful for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases or conditions which can be administered alone or in
combination with low-dose aspirin.  Thus, the invention provides for a clearly superior profile than that hitherto obtainable in that it provides efficacy in treating chronic cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases or conditions, effectively reducing the risk
of thrombotic cardiovascular events and possibly renal side effects and at the same time reduces the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The invention encompasses novel compounds of Formula I, which are nitric oxide-releasing prodrugs of diaryl-2-(5H) furanones useful in the treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases.

and the NO-COX-2 inhibitor are realized by the patient at substantially the same time.  Thus, for example, if a COX-2 selective inhibitor and NO releasing aspirin are both administered on a once a day basis, the interval of separation between sequential
administration of the two agents can be up to twelve hours apart.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other
therapeutic ingredients.  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases.  Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium,
calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like.  Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts.  Salts derived from pharmaceutically
acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline,
N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine,
morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
<BR><BR> The Compound of Formula I is useful for the relief of pain, fever and inflammation of a variety of conditions including rheumatic fever, symptoms associated with influenza or other viral infections, common cold, low back and neck pain,
dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, toothache, sprains and strains, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis degenerative joint diseases (osteoarthritis), gout and ankylosing spondylitis, bursitis, burns, injuries,
following surgical and dental procedures.  In addition, such a compound may inhibit cellular neoplastic transformations and metastic tumor growth and hence can be used in the treatment of cancer.  Compounds of Formula I may also be useful for the
treatment of dementia including pre-senile and senile dementia, and in particular, dementia associated with Alzheimer Disease (i.e. Alzheimer's dementia).
<BR><BR> Compounds of Formula I will also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction by preventing the synthesis of contractile prostanoids and hence may be of use in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, premature labor and asthma.  They will also be
useful to inhibit bone loss (osteoporosis).
<BR><BR> By virtue of its high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and/or its selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) as defined above, compounds of Formula I will prove useful as an alternative to conventional non-steroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID'S) particularly where such non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be contra-indicated such as in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis or with a recurrent history of
gastrointestinal lesions; GI bleeding, coagulation disorders including anemia such as hypoprothrombinemia, haemophilia or other bleeding problems (including those relating to reduced or impaired platelet function); kidney disease (e.g. impaired renal
function); those prior to surgery or taking anticoagulants; and those susceptible to NSAID induced asthma.
<BR><BR> Similarly, compounds of Formula I, will be useful as a partial or complete substitute for conventional NSAID'S in preparations wherein they are presently co-administered with other agents or ingredients.  Thus in further aspects, the invention
encompasses pharmaceutical compositions for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as defined above comprising a non-toxic therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I as defined above and one or more ingredients such as another
pain reliever including acetominophen or phenacetin; a potentiator including caffeine; an H.sub.2-antagonist, aluminum or magnesium hydroxide, simethicone, a decongestant including phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudophedrine, oxymetazoline,
ephinephrine, naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxyephedrine; an antiitussive including codeine, hydrocodone, caramiphen, carbetapentane, or dextramethorphan; a diuretic; a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine.  In addition the
invention encompasses a method of treating cyclooxygenase mediated diseases comprising: administration to a patient in need of such treatment a non-toxic therapeutically effect amount of the compound of Formula I, optionally co-administered with one or
more of such ingredients as listed immediately above.
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and are thereby useful in the treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as enumerated above.  This activity is illustrated by their ability to selectively inhibit
cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1.  Accordingly, in one assay, the ability of the compounds of this invention to treat cyclooxygenase mediated diseases can be demonstrated by measuring the amount of prostaglandin E.sub.2 (PGE.sub.2) synthesized in
the presence of arachidonic acid, cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 and a compound of Formula I. The IC.sub.50 values represent the concentration of inhibitor required to return PGE.sub.2 synthesis to 50% of that obtained as compared to the
uninhibited control.  For the treatment of any of these cyclooxygenase mediated diseases, compounds of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.  The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.  In addition to the treatment of
warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.
<BR><BR> As indicated above, pharmaceutical compositions for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as defined may optionally include one or more ingredients as listed above.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules,
or syrups or elixirs.  Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting
of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.  Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable
excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.  These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for
example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.  The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay
disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.  For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.  They may also be coated by
the technique described in the U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.
<BR><BR> Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the
active ingredients is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.
<BR><BR> Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.  Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, methylcellulose,
hydroxypropylmethy-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty
acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids
and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate.  The aqueous suspensions may also
contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.
<BR><BR> Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin.  The oily suspensions may contain a thickening
agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol.  Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation.  These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an
anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.
<BR><BR> Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.  Suitable
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.  Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions.  The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of
these.  Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the
said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.  The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.
<BR><BR> Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose.  Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.  The pharmaceutical
compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension.  This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned
above.  The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol.  Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that
may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.  In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.  For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic
mono- or diglycerides.  In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
<BR><BR> Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug.  These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug.  Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.
<BR><BR> For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed.  (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Dosage levels of the
order of from about 0.01 mg to about 140 mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day.  For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by
the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 g per patient per day, preferably 2.5 mg to 1 g per patient per day.
<BR><BR> The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.  For example, a formulation intended for the
oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition.  Dosage unit forms will
generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.
<BR><BR> It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of
excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.
<BR><BR> Methods of Synthesis
<BR><BR> Stilbene derivatives useful as cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,849,943, which is hereby incorporate by reference in its entirety.
<BR><BR> The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following methods:
<BR><BR> Method A-1
<BR><BR> Treatment of a phenyl acetic with iPrMgCl in THF followed by the addition of acetophenone yields the corresponding aldol adducts.  Esterification followed by dehydration results in the formation of the substituted stilbene iv.  Conversion of the
para-bromide substituent of iv to, for example, a methylsulfone can be accomplished by treatment with methanesulfinic acid sodium salt with CuI in NMP.  Subsequent bromination of the allylic methyl group in v can be accomplished using standard conditions
such as NBS with Bz.sub.2O.sub.2 in CCl.sub.4.  Introduction of the nitrate functional group is accomplished through the action of AgNO.sub.3 in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile.  Alternatively, the intermediate bromide can be displaced with a
carboxylate salt to yield the corresponding ester such as ix.  Introduction of the nitrate in this case can be accomplished by, for example, deprotection of a primary silyl ether, conversion of the liberated alcohol into a bromide followed by treatment
with AgNO.sub.3 to deliver compounds such a x.
<BR><BR> ##STR00025## ##STR00026## ##STR00027## Method A-2:
<BR><BR> Diphenyl lactone xiv is reduced to the corresponding diol xv by a suitable reducing agent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, hexane, tetrahydro-furan or ether.  The diol xv can be acylated with a
variety of agents such as acid chlorides, chloroformates or ethyl esters to yield products such as xvii.  Oxidation of the primary alcohol can be accomplished using; for example, a two step procedure by first oxidizing to the aldehyde with Dess-Martin
reagent in CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2 followed by further oxidation with the using of sodium chlorite.  Subsequent esterification can be realized by mixing the carboxylic acid with an alcohol (R4OH) with an appropriate dehydrating agent such as DCC or EDCI. 
Introduction of the nitrate moiety follows the protocol described in Method A-1.
<BR><BR> ##STR00028## ##STR00029## Method A-3:
<BR><BR> A diphenyl maleic anhydride 18 can be reduced to diol xv with suitable hydride reducing agents such as di-isobutyl aluminum hydride or lithium aluminum hydride.  Solvents such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran or ether, or a mixture thereof are
suitable for the reduction.

<BR><BR> Assays for Determining Biological Activity
<BR><BR> The compounds of Formula I may be tested using the following assays to determine their biological activity.
<BR><BR> Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase Activity
<BR><BR> Compounds are tested as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity in whole cell and microsomal cyclooxygenase assays.  Both of these assays measure prostaglandin E.sub.2 (PGE.sub.2) synthesis in response to arachidonic acid, using a
radioimmunoassay.  Cells used for whole cell assays, and from which microsomes are prepared for microsomal assays, are human osteosarcoma 143 cells (which specifically express cyclooxygenase-2) and human U-937 cells (which specifically express
cyclooxygenase-1).  In these assays, 100% activity is defined as the difference between prostaglandin E.sub.2 synthesis in the absence and presence of arachidonate addition.  IC.sub.50 values represent the concentration of putative inhibitor required to
return PGE.sub.2 synthesis to 50% of that obtained as compared to the uninhibited control.
<BR><BR> 1.  Microsomal Cyclooxygenase Assay
<BR><BR> Cox microsomal fractions are prepared as previously described (Percival et al., Arch.  Biochem.  Biophys.  (1994) 315:111 118).  The enzyme reactions are performed in 50 mM KPi pH 8.0, 1 .mu.M heme, 1 mM phenol supplemented with 10 .mu.g/ml of
each Cox-1 or Cox-2 microsomal fractions.  1 .mu.l DMSO or test compound (100 fold stock concentrated in DMSO) are added to 100 .mu.l buffer.  The enzyme reaction is initiated 15 minutes later by the addition of 10 .mu.l of 100 .mu.M arachidonic acid. 
The enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature before being stopped by the addition of 101 .mu.l 1 N HCl.  PGE.sub.2 levels are then determined by EIA (Assay Designs) using the manufacturer's instruction.
<BR><BR> By way of example, Example 9 gave IC.sub.50 values of &gt;100 .mu.M against both microsomal human COX-1 and COX-2.  This demonstrates that the unconverted prodrug is inactive against both COX-1 and COX-2.
<BR><BR> Human Whole Blood Cyclooxygenase Assay
<BR><BR> Assays are performed as described in Brideau et al. (1996) Inflammation Res.  45:68 74 and as summarized below.
<BR><BR> 1.  COX-2 (LPS-Induced PGE.sub.2 Production):
<BR><BR> Fresh blood is collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from healthy male volunteers.  These subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.  The blood is
initially pre-incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 100 .mu.g/ml (Sigma Chem, #L-2630 from E. coli, serotype 0111:B4; diluted in 0.1% w/v bovine serine albumin in phosphate buffered saline).  Five minutes later, 500 .mu.L aliquots of the
LPS-treated blood are incubated with either 2 .mu.L vehicle (DMSO) or 2 .mu.L of test compound in DMSO for 24 h at 37.degree.  C. (for induction of COX-2).  Unstimulated control blood at time zero (no LPS) is used as blank.  At the end of the 24 h
incubation, the blood is centrifuged at 3,000 rpms for 10 min at 4.degree.  C. to obtain plasma.  The plasma is assayed for PGE.sub.2 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, 901-001) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
<BR><BR> 2.  COX-1 (Clotting-Induced TXB.sub.2 Production):
<BR><BR> Fresh blood from male or female volunteers is collected into vacutainers containing no anticoagulants.  These subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection. 
Aliquots of 500 .mu.L are immediately transferred to polypropylene tubes preloaded with 2 .mu.L of either DMSO or 2 .mu.L of test compound in DMSO.  The tubes are vortexed and incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 1 h to allow the blood to clot.  At the end of
the incubation, serum is obtained by centrifugation (3,000 rpms for 10 min at 4.degree.  C.).  The serum is obtained and is assayed for TXB.sub.2 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, 901-002) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
<BR><BR> Results
<BR><BR> Using the above assay, it can be demonstrated that the compounds of the invention have a COX-2 potency and COX-2/COX-1 selectivity comparable to rofecoxib and thus, the prodrug compounds of the invention convert in vivo to rofecoxib.
<BR><BR> Representative Rat Paw Edema Assay--Protocol
<BR><BR> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 200 g) are fasted overnight and are given p.o., either vehicle (1% methocell) or a test compound in the morning.  One hr later, a line drawn using a permanent marker at the level above the ankle in one hind paw to
define the area of the paw to be monitored.  The paw volume (V.sub.Oh) is measured using a plethysmometer (Ugo-Basile, Italy) based on the principle of water displacement.  The animals are then injected subplantarly with 50 ul of a 1% carrageenan
solution in saline (sigma Chem) into the paw using an insulin syringe with a 25-gauge needle (i.e. 500 ug carrageenan per paw).  Three hr later, the paw volume (V.sub.3h) is measured and the increases in paw volume (V.sub.3h-V.sub.Oh) are calculated. 
Paw edema data are the compared with the vehicle-control group and percent inhibitions calculated taking the values in the control group as 100%.  All treatment groups are coded to eliminate observer bias.
<BR><BR> By way of example, the results of the above assay for Example 3 are as follows:
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00002 dose (mg/kg) Paw Edema (% inhibition) 1 42 3 51 10 68 30 79
<BR><BR> Acute Gastric Erosion Model in Rats
<BR><BR> The gastric protective effects of the compounds of the present invention co-administration with aspirin may be evaluated in the following assay.
<BR><BR> Male Wistar rats (200 250 g) were fasted for 16 18 h prior to use for experiment.  Aspririn, rofecoxib in combination with aspirin (dosed separately), or test compound in combination with aspirin (dosed separately) were given on the morning of
the experiment at a dosing volume of 1 ml/kg in 0.5% methocel.  Three hr later, the animals were euthanized by CO.sub.2 inhalation and the stomach removed, rinsed in saline and prepared for imaging processing.  Microscopic pictures of the stomach were
taken using a digital camera and gastric erosions were measured using an imaging software by an observer unaware of the treatment groups.  The length of gastric erosions was measured in mm and the total length of all erosions from each stomach was
obtained and used as gastric damage score.
<BR><BR> This model is also described in S. Fiorucci, et al., Gastroenterology, vol. 123, pp.  1598 1606, 2002 and M. Souza, et al., Am.  J. Physiol.  Gastrointest.  Liver Physiol., vol. 285, pp.  G54 G61, 2003.
<BR><BR> NSAID-Induced Gastropathy in Rats
<BR><BR> Rationale
<BR><BR> The major side effect of conventional NSAIDs is their ability to produce gastric lesions in man.  Rats are sensitive to the actions of NSAIDs and have been used commonly in the past to evaluate the gastrointestinal side effects of current
conventional NSAIDs.  In the present assay, NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage is observed by measuring urinary .sup.51Cr excretion after oral dosing of .sup.51Cr-EDTA.  Urinary .sup.51Cr excretion is a well-established and sensitive technique to
detect gastrointestinal integrity in animals and man.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 200 g) are administered orally a test compound either once (acute dosing) or in multiple doses for a few days (chronic dosing).  Immediately after the administration of the last dose, the rats are given an oral dose
of .sup.51Cr-EDTA (10 .mu.Ci/rat).  The animals are placed individually in metabolism cages with food and water ad lib.  Urine is collected for a 24 hr period and .sup.51Cr urinary excretion is calculated as a percent of total ingested dose.
<BR><BR> Protein-Losing Gastrophathy in Squirrel Monkeys
<BR><BR> Rationale
<BR><BR> Protein-losing gastropathy (manifested as appearance of circulating cells and plasma proteins in the GI tract) is a significant and dose-limiting adverse response to NSAIDs.  This can be quantitatively assessed by intravenous administration or
.sup.51CrCl.sub.3 solution.  This isotopic ion can avidly bind to cell and serum globins and cell endoplasmic reticulum.  Measurement of radioactivity appearing in feces collected for 24 hr after administration of the isotope thus provides a sensitive
and quantitative index of protein-losing gastropathy.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Groups of male squirrel monkeys (0.8 to 1.4 kg) are treated by gavage with 1% methocel or a test compounds at multiple doses for a few days.  Intravenous .sup.51 Cr (5 .mu.Ci/kg in 1 ml/kg PBS) is administered 1 hr after the last drug/vehicle
dose, and feces collected for 24 hr in a metabolism cage and assessed for excreted .sup.51 Cr by gamma-counting.  .sup.51Cr fecal excretion is calculated as a percent of total injected dose.
<BR><BR> Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Rings in Male Spargue-Dawley Rats
<BR><BR> Preparation of Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Rings
<BR><BR> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) are euthanized by intraperiton injection of a high dose of sodium pentobarbitone (80 100 mg/kg).  The thoracic aorta is rapidly excised and immediately placed in a Petri
dish containing warm (37.degree.  C.) oxygenated (95% 0, and 5% CO.sub.2) Kreb's buffer (composition per millimolar: NaCl (119); KCl (4.69); CaCl.sub.2.H.sub.2O (2.52); MgSO.sub.4.7H.sub.2O (0.57); NaHCO.sub.2, (25); NaH.sub.2PO.sub.4.H.sub.2O (1.01) and
glucose (11.1)}.  Under a stereoscopic dissecting microscope, the aorta is cleaned, freed from adhering fat and connective tissues.  The tissue is cut into ring segments, each approximately 2 3 mm in length.
<BR><BR> For experiments to measure relaxation of the tissue under various conditions, a stainless steel tissue holder and a U-shaped stainless steel wire are inserted into the lumen of the aortic ring.  The tissue holder anchored the ring at the bottom
of the organ bath whereas the end of the U-shaped steel wire is tied with fine silk thread so that it connected to the FT-202 transducer.  The tissue holder and the steel wire along with the aortic ring are then suspended in a 5-ml, double-jacketed
temperature-controlled glass organ bath (Radnoti Glass Technology, Inc., Monrovia, Calif.) filled with fresh Kreb's buffer.  A mixture of 95% O.sub.2 and 5% CO.sub.2 is bubbled through a porous sintered disc at the bottom of the bath.  The rings are
given an initial resting tension of 1.5 g and the preparation is allowed to equilibrate at the initial tension for about 90 minutes.  During this equilibration period, the bath fluid is changed every 15 minutes and replaced with fresh prewarmed
(37.degree.  C.) Kreb's buffer.  The isometric tension of the aortic muscle at rest and its response to different stimuli are recorded on a Power Macintosh 6100 computer via a MacLab 8/S computer interface (CB Sciences, Inc, Milford, Mass.) after an
initial amplification through a low-noise ETH-400 bioamplifier (CB Sciences, Inc, Milford, Mass.).  Contractile responsiveness of the tissue strips is established with 10 .mu.M phenylephrine, and the strips are incubated with the drug for 20 minutes to
establish a steady level of contraction.
