</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p>The present invention relates to the delivery of anti-migraine compounds
     through an inhalation route. Specifically, it relates to aerosols
     containing lidocaine, <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride
     that are used in inhalation therapy. In a composition aspect of the
     present invention, the aerosol comprises particles comprising at least 5
     percent by weight of lidocaine, <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or
     lisuride. In a method aspect of the present invention, one of lidocaine,
     <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride is delivered to a mammal
     through an inhalation route. The method comprises: a) heating a
     composition, wherein the composition comprises at least 5 percent by
     weight of lidocaine, <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride, to
     form a vapor; and, b) allowing the vapor to cool, thereby forming a
     condensation aerosol comprising particles, which is inhaled by the mammal.
     In a kit aspect of the present invention, a kit for delivering lidocaine,
     <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride through an inhalation
     route to a mammal is provided which comprises: a) a composition comprising
     at least 5 percent by weight of lidocaine, <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem,
     isometheptene, or lisuride; and, b) a device that forms a lidocaine,
     <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol from
     the composition, for inhalation by the mammal.

<BR><BR>Formation of Lidocaine, Verapamil, Diltiazem, Isometheptene, or Lisuride Containing Aerosols
<BR><BR>Any suitable method is used to form the aerosols of the present invention.  A preferred method, however, involves heating a composition comprising lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride to form a vapor, followed by cooling of
the vapor such that it condenses to provide a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride comprising aerosol (condensation aerosol).  The composition is heated in one of four forms: as pure active compound (i.e., pure lidocaine,
verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride); as a mixture of active compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient; as a salt form of the pure active compound; and, as a mixture of active compound salt form and a pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient.
<BR><BR>Salt forms of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride are either commercially available or are obtained from the corresponding free base using well known methods in the art.  A variety of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are
suitable for aerosolization.  Such salts include, without limitation, the following: hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, formic acid, and fumaric acid salts.
<BR><BR>Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be volatile or nonvolatile.  Volatile excipients, when heated, are concurrently volatilized, aerosolized and inhaled with lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride.  Classes of such
excipients are known in the art and include, without limitation, gaseous, supercritical fluid, liquid and solid solvents.  The following is a list of exemplary carriers within the classes: water; terpenes, such as menthol; alcohols, such as ethanol,
propylene glycol, glycerol and other similar alcohols; dimethylformamide; dimethylacetamide; wax; supercritical carbon dioxide; dry ice; and mixtures thereof.
<BR><BR>Solid supports on which the composition is heated are of a variety of shapes.  Examples of such shapes include, without limitation, cylinders of less than 1.0 mm in diameter, boxes of less than 1.0 mm thickness and virtually any shape permeated
by small (e.g., less than 1.0 mm-sized) pores.  Preferably, solid supports provide a large surface to volume ratio (e.g., greater than 100 per meter) and a large surface to mass ratio (e.g., greater than 1 cm.sup.2 per gram).
<BR><BR>A solid support of one shape can also be transformed into another shape with different properties.  For example, a flat sheet of 0.25 mm thickness has a surface to volume ratio of approximately 8,000 per meter.  Rolling the sheet into a hollow
cylinder of 1 cm diameter produces a support that retains the high surface to mass ratio of the original sheet but has a lower surface to volume ratio (about 400 per meter).
<BR><BR>A number of different materials are used to construct the solid supports.  Classes of such materials include, without limitation, metals, inorganic materials, carbonaceous materials and polymers.  The following are examples of the material
classes: aluminum, silver, gold, stainless steel, copper and tungsten; silica, glass, silicon and alumina; graphite, porous carbons, carbon yarns and carbon felts; polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene glycol.  Combinations of materials and coated
variants of materials are used as well.
<BR><BR>Where aluminum is used as a solid support, aluminum foil is a suitable material.  Examples of silica, alumina and silicon based materials include amphorous silica S-5631 (Sigma, St.  Louis, Mo.), BCR171 (an alumina of defined surface area greater
than 2 m.sup.2 /g from Aldrich, St.  Louis, Mo.) and a silicon wafer as used in the semiconductor industry.  Carbon yams and felts are available from American Kynol, Inc., New York, N.Y.  Chromatography resins such as octadecycl silane chemically bonded
to porous silica are exemplary coated variants of silica.
<BR><BR>The heating of the lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride compositions is performed using any suitable method.  Examples of methods by which heat can be generated include the following: passage of current through an
electrical resistance element; absorption of electromagnetic radiation, such as microwave or laser light; and, exothermic chemical reactions, such as exothermic solvation, hydration of pyrophoric materials and oxidation of combustible materials.
<BR><BR>Delivery of Lidocaine, Verapamil, Diltiazem, Isometheptene, or Lisuride Containing Aerosols
<BR><BR>Lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosols of the present invention are delivered to a mammal using an inhalation device.  Where the aerosolis a condensation aerosol, the device has at least three elements: an
element for heating a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing composition to form a vapor; an element allowing the vapor to cool, thereby providing a condensation aerosol; and, an element permitting the mammal to inhale the
aerosol.  Various suitable heating methods are described above.  The element that allows cooling is, in it simplest form, an inert passageway linking the heating means to the inhalation means.  The element permitting inhalation is an aerosol exit portal
that forms a connection between the cooling element and the mammal's respiratory system.
<BR><BR>One device used to deliver the lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol is described in reference to FIG. 1.  Delivery device 100 has a proximal end 102 and a distal end 104, a heating module 106, a power
source 108, and a mouthpiece 110.  A lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride composition is deposited on a surface 112 of heating module 106.  Upon activation of a user activated switch 114, power source 108 initiates heating of
heating module 106 (e.g, through ignition of combustible fuel or passage of current through a resistive heating element).  The lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride composition volatilizes due to the heating of heating module 106
and condenses to form a condensation aerosol prior to reaching the mouthpiece 110 at the proximal end of the device 102.  Air flow traveling from the device distal end 104 to the mouthpiece 110 carries the condensation aerosol to the mouthpiece 110,
where it is inhaled by the mammal.
<BR><BR>Devices, if desired, contain a variety of components to facilitate the delivery of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosols.  For instance, the device may include any component known in the art to control
the timing of drug aerosolization relative to inhalation (e.g., breath-actuation), to provide feedback to patients on the rate and/or volume of inhalation, to prevent excessive use (i.e., "lock-out" feature), to prevent use by unauthorized individuals,
and/or to record dosing histories.
<BR><BR>Dosage of Lidocaine, Verapamil, Diltiazem, Isometheptene, or Lisuride Containing Aerosols
<BR><BR>Lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride are given at strengths of 30 mg, 40 mg, 30 mg, 65 mg, and 0.2 mg respectively for the treatment of migraine headaches.  As aerosols, 10 mg to 50 mg of lidocaine, 10 mg to 60 mg of
verapamil, 10 mg to 50 mg of diltiazem, 5 mg to 200 mg of isometheptene, and 0.05 mg to 0.4 mg lisuride are generally provided for the same indication.  A typical dosage of a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride aerosol is either
administered as a single inhalation or as a series of inhalations taken within an hour or less (dosage equals sum of inhaled amounts).  Where the drug is administered as a series of inhalations, a different amount may be delivered in each inhalation. 
The dosage amount of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride in aerosol form is generally no greater than twice the standard dose of the drug given orally.
<BR><BR>One can determine the appropriate dose of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosols to treat a particular condition using methods such as animal experiments and a dose-finding (Phase I/II) clinical trial. 
One animal experiment involves measuring plasma concentrations of drug in an animal after its exposure to the aerosol.  Mammals such as dogs or primates are typically used in such studies, since their respiratory systems are similar to that of a human. 
Initial dose levels for testing in humans is generally less than or equal to the dose in the mammal model that resulted in plasma drug levels associated with a therapeutic effect in humans.  Dose escalation in humans is then performed, until either an
optimal therapeutic response is obtained or a dose-limiting toxicity is encountered.
<BR><BR>Analysis of Lidocaine, Verapamil, Diltiazem, Isometheptene, or Lisuride Containing Aerosols
<BR><BR>Purity of a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol is determined using a number of methods, examples of which are described in Sekine et al., Journal of Forensic Science 32:1271-1280 (1987) and Martin et
a., Journal of Analytic Toxicology 13:158-162 (1989).  One method involves forming the aerosol in a device through which a gas flow (e.g., air flow) is maintained, generally at a rate between 0.4 and 60 L/min. The gas flow carries the aerosol into one or
more traps.  After isolation from the trap, the aerosol is subjected to an analytical technique, such as gas or liquid chromatography, that permits a determination of composition purity.
<BR><BR>A variety of different traps are used for aerosol collection.  The following list contains examples of such traps: filters; glass wool; impingers; solvent traps, such as dry ice-cooled ethanol, methanol, acetone and dichloromethane traps at
various pH values; syringes that sample the aerosol; empty, low-pressure (e.g., vacuum) containers into which the aerosol is drawn; and, empty containers that fully surround and enclose the aerosol generating device.  Where a solid such as glass wool is
used, it is typically extracted with a solvent such as ethanol.  The solvent extract is subjected to analysis rather than the solid (i.e., glass wool) itself.  Where a syringe or container is used, the container is similarly extracted with a solvent.
<BR><BR>The gas or liquid chromatograph discussed above contains a detection system (i.e., detector).  Such detection systems are well known in the art and include, for example, flame ionization, photon absorption and mass spectrometry detectors.  An
advantage of a mass spectrometry detector is that it can be used to determine the structure of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride degradation products.
<BR><BR>Particle size distribution of a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol is determined using any suitable method in the art (e.g., cascade impaction).  An Andersen Eight Stage Non-viable Cascade Impactor
(Andersen Instruments, Smyrna, Ga.) linked to a furnace tube by a mock throat (USP throat, Andersen Instruments, Smyrna, Ga.) is one system used for cascade impaction studies.
<BR><BR>Inhalable aerosol mass density is determined, for example, by delivering a drug-containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the mass collected in the chamber.  Typically, the aerosol is drawn into the chamber
by having a pressure gradient between the device and the chamber, wherein the chamber is at lower pressure than the device.  The volume of the chamber should approximate the tidal volume of an inhaling patient.
<BR><BR>Inhalable aerosol drug mass density is determined, for example, by delivering a drug-containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the amount of active drug compound collected in the chamber.  Typically, the
aerosol is drawn into the chamber by having a pressure gradient between the device and the chamber, wherein the chamber is at lower pressure than the device.  The volume of the chamber should approximate the tidal volume of an inhaling patient.  The
amount of active drug compound collected in the chamber is determined by extracting the chamber, conducting chromatographic analysis of the extract and comparing the results of the chromatographic analysis to those of a standard containing known amounts
of drug.
<BR><BR>Inhalable aerosol particle density is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device and measuring the number of particles of given size collected in the chamber.  The number of
particles of a given size may be directly measured based on the light-scattering properties of the particles.  Alternatively, the number of particles of a given size is determined by measuring the mass of particles within the given size range and
calculating the number of particles based on the mass as follows: Total number of particles=Sum (from size range 1 to size range N) of number of particles in each size range.  Number of particles in a given size range=Mass in the size range/Mass of a
typical particle in the size range.  Mass of a typical particle in a given size range=.pi.*D.sup.3 *.phi./6, where D is a typical particle diameter in the size range (generally, the mean boundary MMADs defining the size range) in microns, .phi.  is the
particle density (in g/mL) and mass is given in units of picograms (g.sup.-12).
<BR><BR>Rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device.  The delivery is for a set period of time (e.g., 3 s), and the number of particles of a
given size collected in the chamber is determined as outlined above.  The rate of particle formation is equal to the number of 100 nm to 5 micron particles collected divided by the duration of the collection time.
<BR><BR>Rate of aerosol formation is determined, for example, by delivering aerosol phase drug into a confined chamber via an inhalation device.  The delivery is for a set period of time (e.g., 3 s), and the mass of particulate matter collected is
determined by weighing the confined chamber before and after the delivery of the particulate matter.  The rate of aerosol formation is equal to the increase in mass in the chamber divided by the duration of the collection time.  Alternatively, where a
change in mass of the delivery device or component thereof can only occur through release of the aerosol phase particulate matter, the mass of particulate matter may be equated with the mass lost from the device or component during the delivery of the
aerosol.  In this case, the rate of aerosol formation is equal to the decrease in mass of the device or component during the delivery event divided by the duration of the delivery event.
<BR><BR>Rate of drug aerosol formation is determined, for example, by delivering a lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol into a confined chamber via an inhalation device over a set period of time (e.g., 3 s). 
Where the aerosol is pure lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride, the amount of drug collected in the chamber is measured as described above.  The rate of drug aerosol formation is equal to the amount of lidocaine, verapamil,
diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride collected in the chamber divided by the duration of the collection time.  Where the lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosol comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,
multiplying the rate of aerosol formation by the percentage of lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride in the aerosol provides the rate of drug aerosol formation.
<BR><BR>Utility of Lidocaine, Verapamil, Diltiazem, Isometheptene, or Lisuride Containing Aerosols
<BR><BR>The lidocaine, verapamil, diltiazem, isometheptene, or lisuride containing aerosols of the present invention are typically used for the treatment of migraine headaches.
<BR><BR>The following examples are meant to illustrate, rather than limit, the present invention.
<BR><BR>Lidocaine, verapamil hydrochloride, diltiazem hydrochloride, and lisuride are commercially available from Sigma (www.sigma-aldrich.com).  The preparation of isometheptene is described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  2,230,753 and 2,230,754.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>General Procedure for Obtaining Free Base of a Compound Salt
<BR><BR>Approximately 1 g of salt (e.g., mono hydrochloride) is dissolved in deionized water (.about.30 mL).  Three equivalents of sodium hydroxide (1 N NaOH.sub.aq) is added dropwise to the solution, and the pH is checked to ensure it is basic.  The
aqueous solution is extracted four times with dichloromethane (.about.50 mL), and the extracts are combined, dried (Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4) and filtered.  The filtered organic solution is concentrated using a rotary evaporator to provide the desired free
base.  If necessary, purification of the free base is performed using standard methods such as chromatography or recrystallization.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>General Procedure for Volatilizing Compounds from Halogen Bulb
<BR><BR>A solution of drug in approximately 120 .mu.L dichloromethane is coated on a 3.5 cm.times.7.5 cm piece of aluminum foil (precleaned with acetone).  The dichloromethane is allowed to evaporate.  The coated foil is wrapped around a 300 watt halogen
tube (Feit Electric Company, Pico Rivera, Calif.), which is inserted into a glass tube sealed at one end with a rubber stopper.  Running 90 V of alternating current (driven by line power controlled by a variac) through the bulb for 5 s or 3.5 s affords
thermal vapor (including aerosol), which is collected on the glass tube walls.  Reverse-phase HPLC analysis with detection by absorption of 225 nm light is used to determine the purity of the aerosol.  (When desired, the system is flushed through with
argon prior to volatilization.) To obtain higher purity aerosols, one can coat a lesser amount of drug, yielding a thinner film to heat.  A linear decrease in film thickness is associated with a linear decrease in impurities.
<BR><BR>The following aerosols were obtained using this procedure: lidocaine aerosol (7.3 mg, 99.5% purity); verapamil aerosol (1.41 mg, 96.2% purity); diltiazem aerosol (1.91 mg, 97.1% purity); and, lisuride aerosol (0.2 mg, 100% purity).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>Particle Size, Particle Density, and Rate of InhalableParticle Formation of Lidocaine Aerosol
<BR><BR>A solution of 12.2 mg lidocaine in 100 .mu.L dichloromethane was spread out in a thin layer on the central portion of a 3.5 cm.times.7 cm sheet of aluminum foil.  The dichioromethane was allowed to evaporate.  Assuming a drug density of about 1
g/cc, the calculated thickness of the tramadol thin layer on the 24.5 cm.sup.2 aluminum solid support, after solvent evaporation, is about 5.0 microns.  The aluminum foil was wrapped around a 300 watt halogen tube, which was inserted into a T-shaped
glass tube.  Both of the openings of the tube were sealed with parafilm, which was punctured with fifteen needles for air flow.  The third opening was connected to a 1 liter, 3-neck glass flask.  The glass flask was further connected to a large piston
capable of drawing 1.1 liters of air through the flask.  Alternating current was run through the halogen bulb by application of 90 V using a variac connected to 110 V line power.  Within 1 s, an aerosol appeared and was drawn into the 1 L flask by use of
the piston, with collection of the aerosol terminated after 6 s. The aerosol was analyzed by connecting the 1 L flask to an eight-stage Andersen non-viable cascade impactor.  Results are shown in table 1.  MMAD of the collected aerosol was 2.4 microns
with a geometric standard deviation of 2.1.  Also shown in table 1 is the number of particles collected on the various stages of the cascade impactor, given by the mass collected on the stage divided by the mass of a typical particle trapped on that
stage.  The mass of a single particle of diameter D is given by the volume of the particle, .pi.D.sup.3 /6, multiplied by the density of the drug (taken to be 1 g/cm.sup.3).  The inhalable aerosol particle density is the sum of the numbers of particles
collected on impactor stages 3 to 8 divided by the collection volume of 1 L, giving an inhalable aerosol particle density of 4.2.times.10.sup.6 particles/mL.  The rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation is the sum of the numbers of particles
collected on impactor stages 3 through 8 divided by the formation time of 6 s, giving a rate of inhalable aerosol particle formation of 7.0.times.10.sup.8 particles/second.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>Drug Mass Density and Rate of Drug Aerosol Formation of Lidocaine Aerosol
<BR><BR>A solution of 10.4 mg lidocaine in 100 .mu.L dichloromethane was spread out in a thin layer on the central portion of a 3.5 cm.times.7 cm sheet of aluminum foil.  The dichloromethane was allowed to evaporate.  Assuming a drug density of about 1
g/cc, the calculated thickness of the tramadol thin layer on the 24.5 cm.sup.2 aluminum solid support, after solvent evaporation, is about 4.2 microns.  The aluminum foil was wrapped around a 300 watt halogen tube, which was inserted into a T-shaped
glass tube.  Both of the openings of the tube were sealed with parafilm, which was punctured with fifteen needles for air flow.  The third opening was connected to a 1 liter, 3-neck glass flask.  The glass flask was further connected to a large piston
capable of drawing 1.1 liters of air through the flask.  Alternating current was run through the halogen bulb by application of 90 V using a variac connected to 110 V line power.  Within seconds, an aerosol appeared and was drawn into the 1 L flask by
use of the piston, with formation of the aerosol terminated after 6 s. The aerosol was allowed to sediment onto the walls of the 1 L flask for approximately 30 minutes.  The flask was then extracted with acetonitrile and the extract analyzed by HPLC with
detection by light absorption at 225 nm.  Comparison with standards containing known amounts of lidocaine revealed that 3.1 mg of &gt;99% pure lidocaine had been collected in the flask, resulting in an aerosol drug mass density of 3.1 mg/L. The aluminum
foil upon which the lidocaine had previously been coated was weighed following the experiment.  Of the 10.4 mg originally coated on the aluminum, 10.2 mg of the material was found to have aerosolized in the 6 s time period, implying a rate of drug
aerosol formation of 1.7 mg/s.
