<BR><BR> The invention relates to compositions and methods for treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Turmeric is an Asian spice and a traditional remedy since 600 BC.  The turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae).  The rhizome (underground stem) is used to obtain turmeric powder or ground turmeric. 
Turmeric was used for many centuries in Ayurveda, an Indian traditional medical system, for treating and preventing a number of illnesses.  Modern scientific studies of the powerful biologically active compounds contained in the natural product, turmeric
has been shown to have many health benefits including strong anti-cancer properties.  It decreases symptoms of skin cancers and reduces the incidence of chemically caused breast cancer in animals.
<BR><BR> Curcumin is an active ingredient derived from turmeric and it imparts the yellow color in turmeric.  It has several biological activities with beneficial effects on cancer prevention and cure, and on a variety of other diseases such as
arthritis, wound healing and Alzheimer's disease.  In addition to curcumin there are several other biologically active compounds in turmeric which have not received much attention but have strong biological activity.  Curcumin has been shown to be
effective in three ways in attacking cancer.  It suppresses transformation, proliferation, and metastasis of tumors.  Curcumin has been shown to have protective and therapeutic effects against cancers of the blood, skin, pancreas, lung, oral cavity, and
intestinal tract.  Curcumin is shown to be multi-targeted since it modulates multiple cell signaling pathways.  Curcumin asserts its anti-tumor activity by altering the dysregulated cell cycle via (a) cyclin-dependent, (b) p53-dependent and (c)
p53-independent pathways.
<BR><BR> However, curcumin is poorly bio-available following oral administration.  The results suggest that doses of curcumin required to furnish hepatic levels sufficient to exert pharmacological activity are probably not feasible in humans and further
research on both the biological activity and bioavailability of dietary polyphenols is needed to properly assess their usefulness for the prevention and treatment of disease.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The inventor has discovered a series of novel compounds and formulations having anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or anti-cancer activity.  Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a turmeric oil extract obtained by high vacuum
distillation of turmeric oil and collecting a distillate at 70-100.degree.  C., at 105 to 118.degree.  C. or at 100-130.degree.  C.
<BR><BR> In another aspect, the invention provides curcumin derivatives having the structure shown in formula (I):
<BR><BR> ##STR00001##
<BR><BR> wherein:
<BR><BR> R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are independently H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted cyclyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally
substituted heteroaryl, a peptide, --C(O)R.sup.3, --C(O)OR.sup.3, or --C(O)NR.sup.3R.sup.3, provided that at least one of R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 is not H, or both of R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are not octyl or hexadecyl, or one of R.sup.1 or R.sup.2 is not H and
the other is not octyl or hexadecyl;
<BR><BR> R.sup.3 is independently for each occurrence H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted cyclyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted aryl,
optionally substituted heteroaryl; and
<BR><BR> analogs, derivatives, isomers, prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
<BR><BR> The inventor has also discovered that carbohydrate-aspirin conjugates unexpectedly have enhanced anti-inflammatory and/or anti-cancer activity relative to unconjugated aspirin.  Thus, the invention provides compounds of formula (II) as
anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agents.  A compound of formula (II) is:
<BR><BR> ##STR00002##
<BR><BR> wherein:
<BR><BR> R.sup.8 is a carbohydrate;
<BR><BR> R.sup.9 is H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, or optionally substituted acyl; and
<BR><BR> analogs, derivatives, isomers, prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
<BR><BR> In yet another aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising turmeric oil or a turmeric oil extract and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents, compounds of formula (I),
compounds of formula (II), fish oil, fish oil extract, and any combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> The invention also provides a composition comprising curcumin and/or a curcumin derivative of formula (I) and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents, compounds of formula (II),
fish oil, fish oil extract, and any combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> The invention further provides a method for treating a subject for inflammation, or a disease or condition associated with inflammation, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a turmeric oil extract described
herein, a compound described herein, a composition described herein, and any combinations thereof to a subject in need thereof.
<BR><BR> The invention also provides a method of treating a subject for cancer, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a turmeric oil extract described herein, a compound described herein, a composition described
herein, and any combinations thereof to a subject in need thereof. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

or anti-cancer activity of a compound.  For example, anti-inflammatory activity can be measured using an assay designed to test the ability of a compound to antagonize the local edema which is characteristic of the inflammatory response.  Examples of
such assays include, but are not limited to, the carrageenan rat edema test, the oxazolone-induced inflamed mouse ear test, and the arachidonic acid-induced inflamed mouse ear test.  Similarly, anti-cancer activity can be determined, for example, by
using the LIVE/DEAD.RTM.  Cell Viability Assays from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif., USA).  Without wishing to be bound by a theory, the turmeric oil and/or the turmeric oil extract has a synergistic anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or anti-cancer activity
in combination with an anti-inflammatory and/or anti-cancer agent.

90:10 to 10:90, 80:20 to 20:80, 70:30 to 30:70, 60:40 to 40:60, or 50:50 ratio.  In some embodiments, the curcumin or the curcumin derivative and the compound ratio is 5:1 to 15:1.  In one embodiment, the curcumin or the curcumin derivative and the
compound ratio is 10:1.  In one embodiment, the curcrumin or the curcumin derivative and the compound ratio is 1:1.  In some embodiments, the composition comprises curcumin and fish oil in a 2:1 ratio by weight.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the composition comprises curcumin or curcumin derivative, fish oil and lecithin.  In some further embodiments of this, the curcumin or curcumin derivative, fish oil and lecithin are present in a ratio of 1-10:1-10:1-10 by
weight.  In one embodiment, the curcumin or curcumin derivative, fish oil and lecithin are present in a ratio of 4:2.5:1 by weight.  Without wishing to be bound by theory, lecithin can increase the mixing ability of the various components of the
composition and also has its own beneficial effect.
<BR><BR> The term "lecithin" is used herein in its art-recognized manner.  See, for example, the United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary, published by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.  (Rockville, Md.).  The term lecithin as
conventionally used in the art refers to pure phosphatidyl choline and also to crude phospholipid mixtures, containing a variety of other compounds such as fatty acids, triglycerides, sterols, carbohydrates and glycolipids.
<BR><BR> Lecithin includes a complex mixture of acetone-insoluble phosphatides, of which phosphatidylcholine is a significant component.  The term lecithin is also used as a synonym for phosphatidylcholine.  Commercially supplied lecithin is typically
derived from egg yolk, soybeans, or corn.  As used herein, the term "lecithin" encompasses phosphatidyl choline obtained naturally or synthetically, including de-oiled or de-gummed products; derivatives of lecithin and combinations of various types of
lecithin.  Commercial lecithin is currently available in more than forty different formulations (from sources such as American Lecithin Co.; Lucas Meyer Inc.  and Central Soya Inc.  among others) varying from crude oily extracts from natural sources to
purified and synthetic phospholipids, all intended to be encompassed by the term "lecithin" as used herein.
<BR><BR> Lecithin can be made more hydrophilic by hydroxylation of unsaturated fatty acid constituents, fractionation or compounding with dispersing agents.  Moreover, lecithin may be hydroxylated by treating the phosphatides with hydrogen peroxide or
peracids in the presence of water-soluble aliphatic carboxylic acids.  Alternatively, lecithin may also be hydrolyzed enzymatically to yield a powdered soybean lecithin.  Another lecithin derivative is lysolecithin, which results from the interaction of
the enzyme phospholipase with lecithin, for example in pancreatic juices.  Therefore lecithin derivatives are compounds which can be the result of hydroxylation or enzymatic reaction, as mentioned above or other chemical modification of lecithin,
included in the broad term "lecithin".
<BR><BR> Some examples of suitable lecithins available from Central Soya Inc.  of Iowa include BLENDMAX, CENTROBAKE, CENTROCAP, CENTROL CA, CENTROLENE, CENTROMIX, CENTROPHASE, CENTROPHIL, NATHIN and PRECEPT.  These names may represent either a single
lecithin, or a series of lecithin products, all of which are considered useful for the purposes described herein.
<BR><BR> When the composition comprises more than one of the above mentioned compounds, ratio of each compound to the curcumin or curcumin derivative can be determined separately or ratio for the total of the compounds can be determined.  Accordingly, in
some embodiments, the composition comprises at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% curcumin derivative.
<BR><BR> Without wishing to be bound by theory, a composition described herein may comprise a small amount (0.1%-5%) of curcumin in the composition as an antioxidant to preserve the composition.
<BR><BR> Some exemplary compositions of this aspect include, but are not limited to, curcumin derivative and aspirin; curcumin derivative and a compound of formula (II); curcumin derivative and curcumin; curcumin ether derivative and aspirin; curcumin

<BR><BR> Without wishing to be bound by theory, combining an anti-inflammatory or an anti-cancer agent with curcumin and/or the curcumin derivative leads to enhanced activity for the anti-inflammatory or the anti-cancer agent.  Accordingly, in some
embodiments, the activity of an anti-inflammatory or an anti-cancer agent is increased by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 1-fold, at least 2-fold, at
least 4-fold, at least 5-fold or more, relative to the activity of the anti-inflammatory, the anti-cancer agent, the curcumin or the curcumin derivative alone.  Without wishing to be bound by a theory, the curcumin and the curcumin derivative have a
synergistic anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or anti-cancer activity in combination with an anti-inflammatory and/or anti-cancer agent.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the composition comprises two or more of turmeric oil fractions, curcumin, curcumin derivarives, and fish oil.  Without wishing to be bound by a theory, a composition comprising two or more of turmeric oil fractions,
curcumin, curcumin derivarives, and fish oil have enhanced anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity relative to the turmeric oil fraction, curcumin, curcumin derivative or fish oil alone.  In other words, a composition comprising two or more of turmeric
oil fractions, curcumin, curcumin derivarives, and fish oil has a synergistic anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity.
<BR><BR>Methods of Use
<BR><BR> The extracts, compounds and compositions described herein have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or anti-cancer properties.  Accordingly, in one aspect the inventions provides a method of treating a subject for inflammation, or a disease or
condition associated with inflammation, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a turmeric oil extract, a curcumin derivative, a curcumin ether derivative, a salicylic acid conjugate, turmeric oil extract comprising
composition, a curcumin derivative comprising composition, or any combinations thereof to a subject in need thereof.
<BR><BR> As used herein, an anti-inflammation treatment aims to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or progression of the inflammation.  Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but
are not limited to, alleviation of a symptom or symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of inflammatory disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and
remission (whether partial or total).  An anti-inflammatory treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.  In one aspect, an anti-inflammatory treatment can completely suppress the inflammatory
response.
<BR><BR> As used herein, "inflammation" refers to the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.  Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious
stimuli as well as initiate the healing process for the tissue.  Accordingly, the term "inflammation" includes any cellular process that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammation mediators and/or the related downstream cellular
events resulting from the actions of the cytokines thus produced, for example, fever, fluid accumulation, swelling, abscess formation, and cell death.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation mediators include, but are not limited to, IL-1-alpha,
IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-alpha, leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF), IFN-gamma, Oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), TGF-beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and chemokines that
chemoattract inflammatory cells.  As used herein, "inflammation" also refers to any cellular process that leads to the activation of caspase-1 or caspase-5.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "inflammation" refers to both acute responses (i.e., responses in which the inflammatory processes are active) and chronic responses (i.e., responses marked by slow progression and formation of new connective tissue). 
Acute and chronic inflammation may be distinguished by the cell types involved.  Acute inflammation often involves polymorphonuclear neutrophils; whereas chronic inflammation is normally characterized by a lymphohistiocytic and/or granulomatous response.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "inflammation" includes reactions of both the specific and non-specific defense systems.  A specific defense system reaction is a specific immune system reaction response to an antigen (possibly including an
autoantigen).  A non-specific defense system reaction is an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes incapable of immunological memory.  Such cells include granulocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils.  Examples of specific types of
inflammation are diffuse inflammation, focal inflammation, croupous inflammation, interstitial inflammation, obliterative inflammation, parenchymatous inflammation, reactive inflammation, specific inflammation, toxic inflammation and traumatic
inflammation.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "specific defense system" is intended to refer to that component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens.  Inflammation is said to result from a response of the specific defense system if
the inflammation is caused by, mediated by, or associated with a reaction of the specific defense system.  Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the response to antigens such as rubella virus,
autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Reynaud's syndrome, multiple sclerosis etc., delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells, etc. Chronic inflammatory diseases and the rejection of transplanted tissue
and organs are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.
<BR><BR> As used herein, a reaction of the "non-specific defense system" is intended to refer to a reaction mediated by leukocytes incapable of immunological memory.  Such cells include granulocytes and macrophages.  As used herein, inflammation is said
to result from a response of the nonspecific defense system, if the inflammation is caused by, mediated by, or associated with a reaction of the non-specific defense system.  Examples of inflammation which result, at least in part, from a reaction of the
non-specific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes secondary to septicemia or trauma; reperfusion injury of myocardial or other tissues; acute
glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders; thermal injury; hemodialysis; leukophoresis; ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease;
necrotizing enterocolitis; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.  The term immune-mediated refers to a process that is either autoimmune or inflammatory in nature.
<BR><BR> The term "inflammatory diseases" refers to diseases and conditions associated with inflammation.  Exemplary inflammatory diseases include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease,
ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, vaculitis, allergic inflammation such as allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and contact hypersensitivity.  Other examples of
inflammatory diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves' disease (overactive thyroid), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (underactive thyroid), Type 1 diabetes
mellitus, celiac disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, primary biliary sclerosis/cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, Goodpasture's syndrome,
Wegener's granulomatosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis/giant cell arteritis, chronic fatigue syndrome CFS), psoriasis, autoimmune Addison's Disease, ankylosing spondylitis, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome, aplastic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Myasthenia gravis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, optic neuritis, Ord's thyroiditis, pemphigus, pernicious anaemia, polyarthritis in dogs, Reiter's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, warm
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Wegener's granulomatosis, fibromyalgia (FM), autoinflammatory PAPA syndrome, Familial Mediaterranean Fever, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, the neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease,
inflammatory or allergic diseases (e.g., systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies, insect sting allergies), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., colitis, ileitis and enteritis; vaginitis), psoriasis and inflammatory dermatoses
(e.g., dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria, vasculitis, spondyloarthropathies, scleroderma, respiratory allergic diseases (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases), autoimmune diseases
(e.g. arthritis (rheumatoid and psoriatic), osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, glomerulonephritis, and the like), graft rejection (including allograft rejection and graft-v-host disease), and other
diseases in which undesired inflammatory responses are to be inhibited (e.g., myositis, inflammatory CNS disorders such as stroke and closed-head injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, encephalitis, meningitis, osteoporosis, gout,
hepatitis, nephritis, sepsis, sarcoidosis, conjunctivitis, otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis and Bechet's syndrome), chronic prostatitis, glomerulonephritis, inflammatory bowl diseases, pelvic inflammatory disease, reperfusion
injury, silicosis, vasculitis, inflammatory myopathies, hypersensitivities, migraine, psoriasis, gout, and atherosclerosis.
<BR><BR> Without wishing to be bound by theory, one mechanism by which administration of turmeric oil extract and/or curcumin derivatives may treat disease is through inhibition of the activity of AP-1, NF-.kappa.B and/or GSTP1-1.  Inhibition of
NF-.kappa.B results in a decrease in NF-.kappa.B activity, and includes direct inhibition and indirect inhibition.  Direct inhibition is the direct effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on NF-.kappa.B and its activity.  For
example, one type of direct inhibition of NF-.kappa.B is a block of NF-KB DNA interactions.  Indirect inhibition, on the other hand, involves the effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on other compounds involved in the regulation
of NF-.kappa.B that leads to a decrease in NF-.kappa.B activity.  For example, as phosphorylation of the NF-.kappa.B regulator I.kappa.B by I.kappa.B kinases (IKK) or Src family kinases (SFK) results in a dysregulation of NF-.kappa.B, and an accompanying
increase in NF-.kappa.B activity, inhibition of IKK or SFK by turmeric oil extracts and/or curcumin derivatives provides an example of indirect inhibition.
<BR><BR> Inhibition of AP-1 results in a decrease in AP-1 activity, and includes direct inhibition and indirect inhibition.  Direct inhibition is the direct effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on AP-1 (or its subunits) and its
activity.  Indirect inhibition, on the other hand, involves the effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on other compounds involved in the regulation of AP-1 that leads to a decrease in AP-1 activity.  For example, indirect
inhibition of AP-1 activity may occur as a result of an affect on AP-1 activating proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) or c-Fos-regulating kinase (FRK).
<BR><BR> Inhibition of GSTP1-1 results in a decrease GSTP1-1 activity, and includes direct inhibition and indirect inhibition.  Direct inhibition is the direct effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on GSTP1-1 (or its subunits) and
its activity.  Indirect inhibition, on the other hand, involves the effect of a turmeric oil extract and/or a curcumin derivative on other compounds involved in the regulation of GSTP1-1 that leads to a decrease in GSTP1-1 activity.
<BR><BR> Also described herein is a method of treating a subject afflicted with cancer, a precancerous condition and/or metastasis, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a turmeric oil extract, a curcumin derivative, a
curcumin ether derivative, a salicylic acid conjugate, a composition described herein, or any combinations thereof to a subject in need thereof.  By "reduced" in the context of cancer is meant reduction of at least 10% in the growth rate of a tumor or
the size of a tumor or cancer cell burden.
<BR><BR> As used herein, an anti-cancer treatment aims to reduce, prevent or eliminate cancer cells or the spread of cancer cells or the symptoms of cancer in the local, regional or systemic circulation.  Anti-cancer treatment also means the direct
treatment of tumours, for example by reducing or stabilizing their number or their size (curative effect), but also by preventing the in situ progression of tumour cells or their diffusion, or the establishment of tumours; this also includes the
treatment of deleterious effects linked to the presence of such tumours, in particular the attenuation of symptoms observed in a patient or an improvement in quality of life.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "cancer" refers to an uncontrolled growth of cells that may interfere with the normal functioning of the bodily organs and systems.  Cancers that migrate from their original location and seed vital organs can eventually
lead to the death of the subject through the functional deterioration of the affected organs.  A metastasis is a cancer cell or group of cancer cells, distinct from the primary tumor location resulting from the dissemination of cancer cells from the
primary tumor to other parts of the body.  At the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor mass, the subject may be monitored for the presence of in transit metastases, e.g., cancer cells in the process of dissemination.  As used herein, the term cancer,
includes, but is not limited to the following types of cancer, breast cancer, biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer including glioblastomas and medulloblastomas; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal
cancer, gastric cancer; hematological neoplasms including acute lymphocytic and myelogenous leukemia; T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; hairy cell leukemia; chromic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma; AIDS-associated leukemias and adult
T-cell leukemia lymphoma; intraepithelial neoplasms including Bowen's disease and Paget's disease; liver cancer; lung cancer; lymphomas including Hodgkin's disease and lymphocytic lymphomas; neuroblastomas; oral cancer including squamous cell carcinoma;
ovarian cancer including those arising from epithelial cells, stromal cells, germ cells and mesenchymal cells; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; sarcomas including leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and
osteosarcoma; skin cancer including melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell cancer; testicular cancer including germinal tumors such as seminoma, non-seminoma (teratomas, choriocarcinomas), stromal
tumors, and germ cell tumors; thyroid cancer including thyroid adenocarcinoma and medullar carcinoma; and renal cancer including adenocarcinoma, Wilms tumor.  Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, including adenocarcinoma,
lymphoma, blastoma, melanoma, sarcoma, and leukemia.  More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's lymphoma, pancreatic
cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer such as hepatic carcinoma and hepatoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer such as renal cell
carcinoma and Wilms' tumors, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, esophageal cancer, and various types of head and neck cancer.  Other cancers will be known to the artisan.  In some
embodiments, cancer is pancreatic, breast or prostate cancer.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "precancerous condition" has its ordinary meaning, i.e., an unregulated growth without metastasis, and includes various forms of hyperplasia and benign hypertrophy.  Accordingly, a "precancerous condition" is a disease,
syndrome, or finding that, if left untreated, can lead to cancer.  It is a generalized state associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer.  Premalignant lesion is a morphologically altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than
its apparently normal counterpart.  Examples of pre-malignant conditions include, but are not limited to, oral leukoplakia, actinic keratosis (solar keratosis), Barrett's esophagus, atrophic gastritis, benign hyperplasia of the prostate, precancerous
polyps of the colon or rectum, gastric epithelial dysplasia, adenomatous dysplasia, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC), Barrett's esophagus, bladder dysplasia, precancerous cervical conditions, and cervical dysplasia.
<BR><BR> Without wishing to be bound by theory, administration of a turmeric oil extract, a curcumin derivative, and/or a salicylic acid conjugate can inhibit the activity Glutathione S-transferase Pl-1 (GSTP1-1), NF.kappa.B and/or AP-1.  Inhibition of
GSTP1-1 may occur by affecting gene transcription and/or by direct effects on enzyme activity.
<BR><BR> Administration of the turmeric oil extract, the curcumin derivative, and/or the salicylic acid conjugate is especially advantageous in cases where the cancer cells may develop or have developed resistance to one or more anti-cancer agents;
and/or when the cancer cells overexpress GSTP1-1.  Expression of GSTP1-1 may allow the cancer cell to pump out the anti-cancer agent, and by inhibiting the activity of GSTP1-1, the turmeric oil extract, the curcumin derivative, and/or the salicylic acid
conjugate can preserve or prolong the cytostatic or cytotoxic effects of the anti-cancer agent.  Compositions described herein are particularly useful for improving the effectiveness of anti-cancer agents by preventing GSTP1-1's inhibition of
pro-apoptotic factors, particularly c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
<BR><BR> Curcumin was shown recently to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells in part through its ability to inhibit the expression of GSTP1-1 mRNA and protein, which was demonstrated to be the result of inhibition of the activation of NF.kappa.B.  This
observation that compounds such as curcumin can block activation of NF.kappa.B raises the possibility that synthetic drugs can be developed that are more potent than curcumin, and that these drugs will promote apoptosis in cancer cells.  These drugs
could sensitize cancer cells to conventional adjuvant chemotherapy by blocking the NF.kappa.B-dependent development of the anti-apoptotic prosurvival state, and inhibit the expression of GSTP1-1.  In addition, curcumin inhibits the GSTP1-1 catalyzed
conjugation of glutathione with electrophiles.  Furthermore, curcumin inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells and has anti-metastatic activity, possibly owing to its ability to induce apoptosis by inhibiting NF.kappa.B.
<BR><BR> Curcumin contains two alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl groups, one of which exists as the enol tautomer.  Curcumin reacts with glutathione; this reaction is accelerated by GSTP1-1, indicating that curcumin is a substrate of GSTP1-1, albeit a
poor substrate.  Curcumin also inhibits GSTP1-1 in its conjugation of glutathione with other electrophiles, suggesting that curcumin is both a substrate and an inhibitor of GSTP1-1.  This is consistent with the known inhibition of GSTP1-1 by the
flavonoid quercetin, which, like curcumin, is also a polyphenol.  Curcumin itself has low bioavailability and therefore is not a promising drug.
<BR><BR> Derivatives of curcumin with good bioavailability can provide new anti-cancer drugs that, for example, can inhibit the catalytic activity of GSTP1-1, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy by drugs that normally are
metabolized through GSTP1-1 catalyzed conjugation with glutathione; and/or, through inhibition of GSTP1-1 and/or NF.kappa.B the curcumin derivatives, contribute to improved chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of cancer cells by promoting the pro-apoptotic
state.  While not wishing to be bound by theory, these derivatives thus may have a dual mechanism of action--both the inhibition of the catalytic activity of GSTP1-1 and the down-regulation of GSTP1-1 transcription through inhibition of NF.kappa.B. 
GSTP1-1 inhibitors may limit the ability of GSTP1-1 to inactivate other cancer drugs and can prove to be synergistic when combined with other anti-cancer agents.
<BR><BR> As used herein, a "subject" means a human or animal.  Examples of subjects include primates (e.g., humans, and monkeys).  Usually the animal is a vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal.  Primates include
chimpanzees, cynomologous monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus.  Rodents include mice, rats, woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters.  Domestic and game animals include cows, horses, pigs, deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g.,
domestic cat, canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g., trout, catfish and salmon.  Patient or subject includes any subset of the foregoing, e.g., all of the above, but excluding one or more groups
or species such as humans, primates or rodents.  In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human.  The terms, "patient" and "subject" are used interchangeably herein.  The terms, "patient"
and "subject" are used interchangeably herein.  A subject can be male or female.  A subject can be one who has not been previously diagnosed with inflammation, inflammatory disease or condition, and/or cancer.
<BR><BR> Preferably, the subject is a mammal.  The mammal can be a human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but are not limited to these examples.  Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent
animal models of inflammatory disease or disorder, or as animal models of cancer.  In addition, the methods and compositions described herein can be used to treat domesticated animals and/or pets.
<BR><BR> A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed with inflammation, inflammatory disease or condition, and/or cancer.  Without wishing to be bound by a theory, a subject can be diagnosed as having an inflammatory disease by having
increased levels of at least one inflammatory disease marker compared to the level of that marker in a subject not having the inflammatory disease.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation mediators include, but are not limited to, IL-1-alpha,
IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-alpha, leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF), IFN-gamma, Oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), TGF-beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and chemokines that
chemoattract inflammatory cells.  A number of assays for in vivo state of inflammation are known in the art.  See for example U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,108,899 and 5,550,139, contents of both of which are herein incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR> A method described herein can further comprise selecting a subject who has inflammation, inflammatory disease or condition, and/or cancer.  The method can also comprise the step of diagnosing a subject for inflammation, inflammatory disease or
condition, and/or cancer before onset of administration or treatment regime.
<BR><BR> The phrase "therapeutically-effective amount" as used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a conjugate which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect in at least a sub-population of cells
in an animal at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment.
<BR><BR> Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.  Generally, a therapeutically effective amount can vary with the subject's history, age, condition, sex, as well as the severity and
type of the medical condition in the subject, and administration of other pharmaceutically active agents.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "administer" refers to the placement of a composition into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial localization of the composition at a desired site such that desired effect is produced.  Routes
of administration suitable for the methods of the invention include both local and systemic administration.  Generally, local administration results in more of the composition being delivered to a specific location as compared to the entire body of the
subject, whereas, systemic administration results in delivery to essentially the entire body of the subject.
<BR><BR> A conjugate described herein can be administered by any appropriate route known in the art including, but not limited to, oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), pulmonary,
nasal, rectal, vaginal, and topical (including on the skin, and body cavities, such as buccal, vaginal, rectal and sublingual) administration.
<BR><BR> Exemplary modes of administration include, but are not limited to, injection, infusion, instillation, inhalation, or ingestion.  "Injection" includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intraventricular,
intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, sub capsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, intracerebro spinal, and intrasternal injection and infusion.  In some
embodiments of the aspects described herein, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or injection.  In some embodiments, administration is oral.
<BR><BR>Pharmaceutical Compositions
<BR><BR> For administration to a subject, a compound and/or composition described herein can be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions.  Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more
of a compound and/or composition described herein, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents.  As described in detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be
specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), gavages, lozenges, dragees, capsules, pills,
tablets (e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption), boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural
injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally,
for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingually; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; (8) transmucosally; or (9) nasally.  Additionally, compounds can be implanted into a patient or injected using a drug delivery system.  See, for example,
Urquhart, et al., Ann.  Rev.  Pharmacol.  Toxicol.  24: 199-236 (1984); Lewis, ed.  "Controlled Release of Pesticides and Pharmaceuticals" (Plenum Press, New York, 1981); U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,773,919; and U.S.  Pat.  No. 35 3,270,960, content of all of
which is herein incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR> As used here, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and
animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
<BR><BR> As used here, the term "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" means a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium
or zinc stearate, or steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material.  A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will not promote the raising of an immune response to an agent with which it is admixed, unless so desired.  Each carrier must be "acceptable" in
the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient.  Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose;
(2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6)
gelatin; (7) lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and
soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG); (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and
aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) pH buffered solutions; (21) polyesters, polycarbonates and/or polyanhydrides; (22) bulking agents, such as polypeptides
and amino acids (23) serum component, such as serum albumin, HDL and LDL; (22) C.sub.2-C.sub.12 alcohols, such as ethanol; and (23) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.  Wetting agents, coloring agents, release
agents, coating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, preservative and antioxidants can also be present in the formulation.  The terms such as "excipient", "carrier", "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or the like are used
interchangeably herein.
<BR><BR> The amount of a compound or composition described herein that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound that produces a therapeutic effect.  Generally out of one hundred
percent, this amount will range from about 0.001% to 99% of the compound, preferably from about 0.01% to about 70%, most preferably from 5% to about 30%.
<BR><BR> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD.sub.50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED.sub.50 (the dose
therapeutically effective in 50% of the population).  The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD.sub.50/ED.sub.50.  Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices, are
preferred.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term ED denotes effective dose and is used in connection with animal models.  The term EC denotes effective concentration and is used in connection with in vitro models.
<BR><BR> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans.  The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the
ED.sub.50 with little or no toxicity.  The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.
<BR><BR> The therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays.  A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC.sub.50 (i.e., the concentration of the
therapeutic which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture.  Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.  The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a
suitable bioassay.
<BR><BR> The dosage may be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.  Generally, the compositions are administered so that a compound or composition described herein is given at a dose from 1

derivative are also similar to the parent compound.
<BR><BR> As used herein, a "prodrug" refers to compounds that can be converted via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis) to a therapeutic agent.  Thus, the term "prodrug" also refers to a precursor of
a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable.  A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid or free
hydroxyl.  The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in an organism.  The term "prodrug" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when
such prodrug is administered to a subject.  Prodrugs of an active compound may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the
parent active compound.  Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto
group, respectively.  Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.  See

<BR><BR> Glyceryl Lipid Conjugates of Curcumin:
<BR><BR> Curcumin may be conjugated to glyceryl lipids through a linking group such as succinoyl or glutaryl group.  Such conjugates would be expected to facilitate the uptake of the drug through the lipid bilayer of cell membranes.  The mono or di-lipid
conjugates can be obtained by controlling the molar ratios of curcumin, the linking compounds and the glyceryl lipids.  The glyceryl lipids may include glycerol with one or two fatty acids attached with ester bonds or fatty alkyl groups with ether
linkage.  Different fatty acids may be used for the glyceryl lipids.  This can include saturated as well as mono and poly unsaturated fatty acids.  The unsaturated fatty acids can include omega three fatty acids.  The following scheme illustrates the
synthesis method.
<BR><BR> ##STR00024##
<BR><BR> Curcumin mono or diglutarate can be obtained by controlling the anhydride ratio (one or two equivalents respectively).

<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR>Aspirin-Glucose Conjugate
<BR><BR> Aspirin, is a widely used and relatively safe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and it has been used for over hundred years.  The main uses of aspirin can be summarized as an analgesic, antipyretic, anti-rheumatic agent and
anti-inflammatory agent, may be used to prevent stroke, to prevent heart attack and to prevent cancer, may be used to treat AIDS and to treat problems associated with diabetes (Fowler).  Aspirin is a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. 
Cyclooxygenase derived prostaglandins are involved in inflammatory activity.  Prostaglasndins also are involved in gastrointestinal protection and vascular homeostasis.  Aspirin acetylates Ser530 hydroxyl group in the COX binding site of COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin is a much stronger inhibitor of COX-1 than of COX-2.  See for example, Mead, E. A., Smith, W. L. & DeWitt, d. L., J. Biol Chem., 1993, 268, 6610-6614 and Yeomans, N. D., J Gastroenterol Hepatol.  2010 Nov.  10.  doi:
10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06569.x.  [Epub ahead of print], content of both of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.  Aspirin is not very water soluble, only 0.33 g in 100 mL.  Some of the undesirable side effects of aspirin results
from undissolved particles in the gastrointestinal mucosa casing ulcers and bleeding.  The solubility can be increased considerably by conjugating aspirin to glucose molecule through a systematic approach on a specified carbon of glucose.
<BR><BR> Synthesis of Glucose-Aspirin:
<BR><BR> A glucose-aspirin conjugate was synthesized as shown below.
<BR><BR> ##STR00028##
<BR><BR> Hydroxyl protected glucose, 1,2:5,6-diisopropylglucose, was treated with aspirin in presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to form the acetyl salicylic acid ester on the fourth carbon of glucose.  This ester was treated with acetic acid to
remove the acetonide protecting groups to obtain glucose acetyl salysilate (glucose aspirin).
<BR><BR>Synthesis of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidende-3-(2'-acetyloxybenzoyl)-D-glucose
<BR><BR> Acetylsalicylic acid (12 g, 0.07 moles) was dissolved in 300 mL of ethyl acetate in a 1 liter round bottom flask fitted with anhydrous calcium chloride guard tube.  Dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (8.24 g, 0.04 moles) was added to it resulting in the
formation of a white precipitate.  Diacetone-D-glucose (10 g, 0.04 moles) was added along with dimethylaminopyridine (4.88 g, 0.04 moles).  The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature.  The solid byproduct, dicyclohexyl urea, was removed by
filtration.  The filtrate was washed with 10% potassium carbonate (2.times.300 mL), 10% hydrochloric acid (2.times.300 mL) and with brine (300 mL).  The ethylacetate solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to get 17.8 g. The
crude product, diacetone glucose salicylate (compound 3, scheme 1), was purified over silica gel column to get 8.98 g of product.  NMR (CDCl.sub.3, .delta.): 8.0 (dd, 1H), 7.6 (m, 1H), 7.33 (m, 1H), 7.13 (dd 1H), 5.9 (m, 1H), 5.4 (d, 1H), 4.61 (d, 1H),
4.20-4.37 (m, 2H), 4.03-4.15 (m, 2H), 2.37 (s, 3H), 1.28, 1.32, 1.41, 1.62 (our singlets, 12H).
<BR><BR>Synthesis of 3-(2'-Acetyloxybenzoyl)-D-glucose (Glucose-3-aspirin)
<BR><BR> A mixture of diacetone glucose salicylate (7.6 g) and 70% acetic acid (150 mL) was taken in a 500 mL round bottom flask.  The mixture was refluxed for 2 hours under argon.  The mixture formed a clean solution and it was concentrated under
reduced pressure and dried under high vacuum.  Column purification (silica gel, methylene chloride/methanol) yielded the product, glucose-3-aspirin (compound 5) as a white solid, 1.3 g. NMR (CDCl.sub.3, .delta.): 10.6 (s, 1H), 7.9-8.1 9 m, 1H), 7.5 (m,
1H), 6.8-7.2 (m, 2H), 5.3 (m, 2H), 4.2-4.6 (m, 2H), 3.6-3.8 (m, 2H), 3.0-3.2 (m, 1H), 3.43 (bs, 3H), 1.65 (bs, 3H).
<BR><BR> Elemental analysis: C.sub.15H.sub.18O.sub.9, Calculated: C, 52.63; H, 5.30 Found: C, 52.51; H, 5.42.  Mass: M+1, m/z 343.0999 (M+H calculated formula: C.sub.15H.sub.19O.sub.9.  Solubility of glucose-3-aspirin in water: 2.32 g/100 mL, Aspirin
solubility: 0.33 g/100 mL (1 g in 300 mL water at 25.degree.  C.) (Merck Index, pp.  134, vol. 11, 1989).  Thus, the aspirin-glucose conjugate was 700 times more soluble than aspirin.

<BR><BR>Animal Studies with Glucose Aspirin Conjugates
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods:
<BR><BR> Animals were kept under 13 hour day night cycle.  Animals were given standard diet and water was provided ad, libitum.  All animals were acclimatized for at least one week before the experimental session.  Animals were divided in to five groups. Each group consisted of 8 animals.  Group 1 would get standard drug, aspirin at 100 mg/kg and group 2 was given aspirin 200 mg/kg i.p.  Glucosyl acetyl salicylate was used in two dose levels.  Group 3 was given the glucosyl acetyl salicylate at 100 mg/kg
and group 4 was given this drug at 200 mg/kg i.p.
<BR><BR> Carrageenan Induced Rat Paw Edema:
<BR><BR> Pedal inflammation in albino rats of either sex was produced according to the method of Winter et al., (Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1963; 111: 544-7).  An injection was made with 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan (SIGMA) suspension into the right hind foot of
each rat in the plantar region.  Groups 3 and 4 rats were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with glucosylacetyl salicylate 30 minutes before carrageenan injection.  Control group 5 was given 0.5 ml saline and groups 1 and 2 received aspirin.  Increase in
linear paw circumference was measured by tying a piece of cotton thread round the rat's paw, and noting the point of intersection of two ends on a meter scale.  This was taken as an index of increase in paw volume, which is a measure of oedema (Bamgbose
S O A, Noamesi B K. Planta Med 1981; 42: 392-6).  Measurements were taken immediately before and at 1, 2 and 3 hours after carrageenan injection.  The inhibitory activity was calculated according to the following formula (Awe S O, Olajide O A, Adeboye J

<BR><BR> Tail flick test: Analgesic activity was measured by the tail flick method, using the analgesiometer (Techno, Lucknow, India) as described by D'Armour and Smith (D'Armour F E, Smith D L. A method for determining loss of pain sensation.  J
Pharmacol Exp Ther 1941; 72: 74-9).  Rats were screened for tail flip reaction with a cut-off time of 5 seconds.  For each animal, the tail flick latency was obtained thrice before drug administration and mean was used as pre-drug latency.  The tail
flick latencies were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 h after administration chemicals.  For animals that did not respond within the cut-off time of 10 seconds, the value of the cut-off time was considered as latency period for that animal (Ramabadran

<BR><BR> Statistical analysis: Data was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests.  P&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 shows the effect of drugs on tail flick latency in all groups.  There was significant increase in the tail flick latency with the standard drug aspirin 100 mg/kg (Groupl) and aspirin 200 mg/kg (Group 2) at all times intervals except 180
minutes as compared to control group (p&lt;0.05).  The increase was there till 120 minutes.  There was no statistical significant change in the tail flick latency in the control group (Group 5).  In test group there was significant increase in tail flick
latency with both dose levels i.e. 100 mg/kg (Group 3) and 200 mg/kg (Group 4).  The increase was there till 120 minutes in group 3 and 90 minutes in group 4.  % MPE was more with 100 mg/kg as compared to 200 mg/kg.
<BR><BR> Aspirin 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg significantly increased latency time as compared to control group (p&lt;0.05) at 60 minutes.  The latency time was significantly more at 60 minutes with both doses of aspirin as compared to 100 mg/kg dose of test
compound (FIG. 5).  Percentage (%) MPE was more with 100 mg/kg as compared to 200 mg/kg (FIG. 6).  Percentage MPE was at peak at 120 minutes in all the groups.  There was no statistically significant difference in the latency time with test compound as
compared to control group.
<BR><BR> These results demonstrate that Test compound in doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly suppressed carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and demonstrated significant analgesic activity in tail flick models.

<BR><BR> Carrageen Induced Paw Edema:
<BR><BR> There was significant increase in paw measurements (mm) after carrageen injection in all the groups (Table 5).  The increase was maximum in group 0 and 12 (control groups) verifying the effectiveness of the method.  In % inhibition of paw edema,
all drugs in various groups inhibited the edema.  The standard used (aspirin) significantly inhibited the development of the edema as compared to control groups confirming the validity of the method (FIG. 9).  The formulation NJ1 (50 mg/kg) significantly
inhibited edema at 1 hour as compared to control groups (FIG. 10).  This formulation also inhibited edema at 2 and 3 hours as compared to group 1 (DMSO), but the inhibition was not significant as compared to aspirin (group 5 and 6).  Group 3 (NJ1 100
mg/kg) significantly inhibited edema as compared to DMSO (group 1) at 1 hour only (FIG. 11).  Group 3 (2 and 3 hour) and group 4 (all times) inhibited edema less than the standard drug aspirin (FIG. 12).  NJ2 and NJ3 did not significantly inhibit edema
as compared to control and aspirin.  In fact the percentage inhibition was significantly less with NJ2 (100 and 200 mg/kg-group 3 and 4) and NJ3 (200 mg/kg-group 4).  The % inhibition of paw edema at 3 hours was maximum for NJ 1 (50 mg/kg) followed by
aspirin 200 mg/kg and aspirin 100 mg/kg.

<BR><BR> Carrageenan-induced hind paw edema is the standard experimental model of acute inflammation.  Carrageenan is the agent of choice for testing anti-inflammatory drugs as it is not known to be antigenic and is devoid of apparent systemic effects. 
Moreover, the experimental model exhibits a high degree of reproducibility.  Carrageenan-induced edema is a biphasic response.  The first phase is mediated through the release of histamine, serotonin and kinins whereas the second phase is related to the
release of prostaglandin and slow reacting substances which peak at 3 hour.  See for example, Vinegar, R., Schreiber, W. & Hugo R., J. Pharmacol.  Exp.  Ther., 1969, 166: 96-103.
<BR><BR> The increase in the paw volume following carrageenan administration in the control and aspirin treated group corresponds with the findings of previous workers.  NJ1 produced significant inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema.  The effect
produced is equivalent to the effect of aspirin indicating similar efficacy.  The effect with NJ1 was more at lower dose.  However NJ1 showed dose dependant analgesic activity on tail flick test, higher dose showing more effect.  NJ2 and NJ3 did not show
any significant activity, in fact their effect was lower than the aspirin.  Thus, these results demonstrated that NJ1 has significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in animal models.

<BR><BR>Anti-Cancer Activity of Turmeric Oil Distillation Fraction and Curcumin Analogs
<BR><BR> Assays were performed with 3 cancer cell lines: breast (SKBR3), pancreatic (Panc1), prostate (PC-3) and 1 normal (nor-cancer) cell line (WI-38).  Compounds were delivered to the cells after dissolving in DMSO.  Five dilutions per compound were
tested on a total of 4 cell lines in 96 well plates.  Cellular inhibition was measured using Alamar Blue.  After addition of compound a 24 hour and 48 hour time point using fluorescent plate reader was taken.  Data from plate reader was analyzed in the
following way: % inhibition bar graphs, % inhibition line graphs and IC.sub.50 growth inhibition values.  The results of the experiments are shown in FIGS. 17A-25B.  IC.sub.50 values are summarized in Tables 7-14.  In Tables 7-14, IC.sub.50 units are

<BR><BR> Glucose Aspirin (PMN II-168) Vs.  Aspirin:
<BR><BR> Examining the bar graphs at 24 hours, showed that PMN-II-168 had a modest 20% inhibition of cancer cell growth for the four lower concentrations while aspirin did not seem to inhibit growth by any significant means at 24 hours.  IC.sub.50 for
PMN-II-168 were found to be 2.01E-04, 3.76E-04, 3.99E-04 and 8.32E-05 for SKBR3, WI38 PANC1 and PC-3 cells respectively.  IC.sub.50 for aspirin were found to be 7.31E-04, 6.19E-04, 9.75E-04 and 7.71E-04 for SKBR3, WI38 PANC1 and PC-3 cells respectively. 
IC.sub.50 values are in Molar (M).
<BR><BR> PMN-II-168 at 300 uM did inhibit cancer cell growth very well (up to 60% inhibition) while not playing a significant inhibitory role with the normal WI-38 cell lines.  This was consistent at the various concentrations.  Aspirin however did not
have the same selectivity as PMN-II-168 as WI-38 cells as they were the most efficiently growth repressed at 24 hours.  At 48 hours, while there was little change in aspirin inhibition (except for the highest 300 uM concentration), PMN-II-168 did
significantly better.  PMN-II-168 inhibited breast cancer line (skbr3) proliferation most efficiently (approximately 90% and 60% inhibition at the 300 uM and 150 uM concentration respectively).  It also inhibited Panc-1 (.about.70% and 60%) and PC-3
(.about.85% and 65%) for the two highest concentrations, 300 uM and 150 uM respectively.  Even at the lower concentrations, PMN-II-168 performed significantly better than aspirin.
<BR><BR> Paclitaxel (Taxol) (1 mg) Vs.  NJ-81-4 (Mixture of Turmeric Oil Distillation Fraction NJ-78-12 (10 mg) and Paclitaxel (1 mg)) at 48 Hours:
<BR><BR> Taxol at the 48 hour treatment point was effective in inhibiting prostate (PC-3) cancer cells at all concentrations (.about.60 inhibition) and at the 300 and 150 nM concentrations inhibited the other cancer cell lines more modestly.  On the
other hand, at the same doses, NJ-81-4 was more effective as it inhibited Panc-1 and PC-3 by approximately .about.60% at all concentrations when compared to untreated cells.  SKBR3 cell growth proliferation was also inhibited with NJ-81-4 albeit more
modestly up to (45% inhibition).  In addition to the better inhibition, NJ-81-4 did not affect normal cell growth (WI-38).  Taxol however did have some effect on normal cell growth.
<BR><BR> Turmeric Oil Fraction NJ-78-12 and MT-133-3:
<BR><BR> At the 48 hour time point bar graphs, NJ-78-12 at the higher dose inhibited the cancer cell lines, but at none of the doses affected the normal tissue WI-38 cell line.  Thus, this compound is specific and lacks a general toxicity to cells or
tissue.  MT-133-3 behaved similar to NJ-78-12 except that it inhibited WI-38 growth.  NJ-81-4 also did very nicely giving good inhibition of cancer cells but not the WI-38 cells.
<BR><BR> Curcumin Derivatives Diacetyl Curcumin (NJ-58-1) and Curcumin-Glutarate (MT-76-1):
<BR><BR> The curcumin levels of inhibition were generally higher than NJ-58-1 and MT-76-1.  An exception was with skbr3 breast cancer cells at 300 uM.  All three compounds gave a similar response at 24 hours with skbr3.  At 24 hours, NJ-58-1 was more
specific to cancer cells than curcumin.  The IC.sub.50 data for 24 and 48 hour time points is shown in Tables 8 and 12.  At 24 hours, NJ-58-1 did very well in inhibiting PANC-1 and PC-3 at doses greater than 50 uM.  It inhibited skbr3 cancer lines at
greater than 150 uM doses.  MT-76-1 at 24 hours behaved similarly except that at the lower doses it more specifically inhibited the PANC-1 cell line.  Both compounds at 24 hours didn't have a very significant affect on the WI-38 cell line, which is a
normal cell line, i.e. not a cancerous cell line.  At 24 hours with NJ-58-1, normal lung cells (WI-38) actually grew or were inhibited less than 10%, while with curcumin levels of inhibition at 100, 150 and 300 uM were just over 20%.  Accordingly, these
results demonstrate that NJ-58-1 is more specific than MT-76-1 and curcumin because normal cells behaved similar to cancer cells treated with curcumin.
<BR><BR>Example 8
<BR><BR>Evaluation of Anti-Cancer Activity of Compounds
<BR><BR> The following compounds and combinations were used in this experiment: Gemcitabine.HCl (NJ-92-1), MT-133-3 (NJ-92-2), Gemcitabine.HCl (2 mg)+MT-133-3 (20 mg) (NJ92-3), Paclitaxel (NJ-92-4) and Paclitaxel 2 mg+MT-133-3 (20 mg) (NJ-92-5).
<BR><BR> Determine LD50 (Lethal Dose, 50%) of Testing Compounds:
<BR><BR> Cytotoxicity of the compounds on three different cancer cell lines and one normal cell line was tested.  Four human cell lines including both cancer cell lines (SK-BR-3, PANC-1, PC3) and normal cell line (WI38) were initially employed.  The
cells (20,000 cells/well) were plated onto a 96-well plate for 24 hours before treatment.  The compounds were diluted in the medium and added to the cells at different concentrations for additional 24 hours from 1 ng/ml to 10 ug/ml.  MTT assay was then
performed.
<BR><BR> LD50 was not observed for all these compounds under testing concentrations, demonstrating that these compounds do not have cytotoxicity under the testing conditions (FIGS. 26A-26D).
<BR><BR> Determination of Inhibitory Effect of Compounds on Cell Proliferation:
<BR><BR> The compounds were tested for cancer cell proliferation inhibition.  Based on the data derived from in vitro cytotoxicity, evaluation of cell proliferation was under taken.  Four cell lines were plated onto a 96 well plate for 24 hours before
adding the compounds.  Two different doses (20 ng/ml and 2,000 ng/ml) were employed up to 8 days followed by MTT assay.  DMSO and Taxol were used as negative control and positive controls.  Results are shown in FIGS. 27A-27D.
<BR><BR> Compound #5 (NJ-92-5) displayed inhibitory effect on PANC-1 cell proliferation after 48 h treatment; the compound #5 inhibited PC3 cell proliferation at early treatment, similar to Taxol; the compound #5 showed cytotoxicity on SK-BR-3 cells.  No
significant difference of Compound #5 was noted on normal WI38 cells.
<BR><BR> Compound #3 (NJ-92-3) had minimal effect on cancer cell proliferation.  Significant effect occurred only under high concentration (2,000 ng/ml).
<BR><BR> These results indicate that the mechanism of action of compound #5 (NJ-92-4) is through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, but not cytotoxiticy.
<BR><BR> Determination of GI.sub.50 (50% Inhibition of Cell Growth):
<BR><BR> Since the compounds displayed inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, a GI.sub.50 experiment was performed.  The cells were plated onto a 96 well plate and treated with different concentrations of the compounds from 1 ng/ml to 10 ug/ml for 72
hours followed by MTT assay.  The results are shown in FIGS. 28A-28D and GI.sub.50 values summarized in Table 15.

hind foot of each rat in the plantar region.  The various chemicals were given 30 minutes before carrageenan injection.  Increase in linear paw circumference was measured by tying a piece of cotton thread round the rat's paw, and noting the point of
intersection of two ends on a meter scale.  This was taken as an index of increase in paw volume, which is a measure of edema (Bamgbose, S. O. A. & Noamesi, B. K., Planta.  Med., 1981, 42: 392-396).  Measurements were taken immediately before and at 1, 2
and 3 hours after carrageenan injection.  The inhibitory activity was calculated according to the following formula (Awe S O, Olajide O A, Adeboye J O, Makinde J M. Indian J. Pharmacol., 1998; 30: 38-42):

<BR><BR> Tail flick test: Analgesic activity was measured by the tail flick method, using the analgesiometer (Techno, Lucknow, India) as described by D'Armour and Smith (J. Pharmacol.  Exp.  Ther., 1941, 72: 74-79).  Rats were screened for tail flip
reaction with a cut-off time of 5 seconds.  For each animal, the tail flick latency was obtained thrice before drug administration and mean was used as pre-drug latency.  The tail flick latencies were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 h after
administration of chemicals.  For animals that did not respond within the cut-off time of 10 seconds, the value of the cut-off time was considered as latency period for that animal (Ramabadran, K. & Bansinath, M. Pharmaceutical.  Res., 1986, 3: 263-270).

<BR><BR>Comparison of Anti-Inflammatory and Analgesic Activities of Fish Oil, Turmeric Oil, Curcumin Diacetate, Curcumin Diglutarate and Aspirin
<BR><BR> Fish oil, a distillation fraction of turmeric oil and two derivatives of curcumin (NJ-104-1 to NJ-104-5) were used in this study to determine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of these drugs by oral administration and these were
compared to aspirin.  Anti-inflammatory was evaluated by carrageenan induced paw edema and analgesic activity by tail flick method in rats.
<BR><BR> Albino rats obtained from the central animal house of the institute were used in the study.  The animals were kept under 12 hour day night cycle.  Animals were given standard diet and water was provided ad libium.  All animals were acclimatized
for at least one week before the experimental session.
<BR><BR> Animals were divided into six groups in the carrageenan induced paw edema and tail flick method.  Each group consisted of 8 animals each.  The groups received various drugs orally mixed with food, as given in Table 19.  Carrageenan-induced rat
paw edema and Tail flick test were performed as discussed above in Example 8.  Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Posthoc Bonferroni multi-comparisons.  P&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

<BR><BR> Carrageenan-induced hind paw edema is the standard experimental model of acute inflammation.  Carrageenan is the agent of choice for testing anti-inflammatory drugs as it is not known to be antigenic and is devoid of apparent systemic effects. 
Moreover, the experimental model exhibits a high degree of reproducibility (Winter, et al., Proc.  Soc.  Exp.  Biol.  Med., 1962; 111: 544-547).  Carrageenan-induced edema is a biphasic response.  The first phase is mediated through the release of
histamine, serotonin and kinins whereas the second phase is related to the release of prostaglandin and slow reacting substances which peak at 3 hour (Vinegar R, Schreiber W, & Hugo R., J. Pharmacol.  Exp.  Ther., 969; 166: 96-10).  The increase in the
paw volume following carrageenan administration in the control and aspirin treated group corresponds with the findings of previous workers (Jana U, Chattopadhyay R N, & Shaw B P, Indian J. Pharmacol., 1999; 31: 232-3 and Singh R K & Pandey B L. Indian J.
Physiology Pharmacol., 1996; 40: 355-8).
<BR><BR> Results for the Carrageen-induced paw edema assay are shown in Table 20 and FIG. 38.  Anti-inflammatory activity study at 100 mg/kg showed that turmeric oil distillation fraction, NJ-100-9, had 82% and 76% inhibition of paw edema at 1 hour and 2
hours after drug administration.  Curcumin diacetate was active at all three time points, (1 hr, 2 hr and 3 hr) by 76, 80 and 76% respectively.  Fish oil inhibited paw edema by 66% at the initial time periods and went down to 30% by hour 3.  Curcumin
diglutarate and the mixture of fish oil and turmeric oil showed only modest activities (below 50%) at this dose.

<BR><BR> Results of the tail flick assay are shown in Table 21 and FIG. 40.  The analgesic activity study showed that the combination of NJ-104-3, fish oil and the distillation fraction of turmeric oil (NJ-100-9) (combined at 50:50 ratio), at 100 mg/kg
had strong activity during the initial time periods of 30, 60 and 90 minutes.  The drugs, fish oil (NJ-104-1) and turmeric oil fraction (NJ-104-2) by themselves, were considerably less active then the combination (NJ-104-3).  Curcumin diglutarate showed
strong activity at 90 and 180 minutes.  The activities of fish oil (NJ-104-1), turmeric oil (NJ-104-2) and curcumin diglutarate (NJ-104-5) were stronger than that of aspirin at 90 minutes at this dose.

and determined to be a mixture of .beta.-sesquiphellandrene (50.3%), 7-epi-zingiberene (30.7%) and ar-curcumene (19%) by comparison with published NMR data (Breedan, D. C. & Coates, R. M. Tetrahedron, 1994, 50, 11123; McBrien et al., J. Chem Ecol., 2002,
28, 1797; and Takigawa et al., Appl.  Environ.  Microbio.  1993, 58, 1336).  Percentages were calculated from relative integration values of the resolved peaks of each of the 3 major components.  Comparison of 1H NMR shifts for various components of
turmeric oil fractions are shown in Tables 25-28.
