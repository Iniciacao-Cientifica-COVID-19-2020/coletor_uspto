<BR><BR> The invention disclosed herein generally relates to compositions comprising modified chloroquine compounds having single ring or fused ring moieties and methods of using the same for therapeutic and research applications.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Malaria is a disease caused by various species of hemosporidian blood parasites of the genus Plasmodium (including P. falciparium, P. vivax, P. ovule, and P. malariae).  The human disease process begins with the bite of an infected female
Anopheline mosquito.  Plasmodium sporozoites released from the salivary glands of the mosquito enter the bloodstream and quickly (within about 30 minutes) invade liver cells (hepatocytes).  The liver-stage parasites differentiate and undergo asexual
multiplication resulting in tens of thousands of merozoites which burst from the hepatoctye.  Merozoites then invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) where they undergo an additional round of multiplication.  The clinical signs of malaria, fever and
chills, are associated with the synchronous rupture of infected erythrocytes.
<BR><BR> Malaria is a worldwide public health problem.  Up to 3 million people die of malaria each year, and the total number of people infected with malaria worldwide approaches half a billion.  The impact of this disease, in terms of suffering and
economics, is enormous.  In the past, the inexpensive and orally administered antimalarial drug, chloroquine (CQ), was considered the "gold standard" treatment.
<BR><BR> During its blood stage, the malaria parasite (i.e., a parasite that causes malaria) metabolizes (in its digestive vacuole (DV)) hemoglobin present in erythrocytes.  A by-product of this metabolic process is heme, which would be toxic to the
parasite except for heme detoxification mechanisms developed by the microorganism.  CQ is believed to inhibit heme detoxification in the DV by binding to heme and/or to hemozoin (Ginsburg et al, 1999.  Parasitol.  Today 15:357; Chong and Sullivan.  2003. Biochem.  Pharmacol.  66(11):2201-2212; Leed et al. 2002.  Biochem.  41(32):10245-10255; Egan et al. 2001.  Biochem.  40(1):204-213; Raynes.  1999.  Int.  J. Parasitol.  29(3):367-379; Egan et al. 2000.  J. Med.  Chem. 43(2):283-291; Weissbuch and
Leiserowitz.  2008.  Chem. Rev.  108(11):4899-4914).  This binding, in part, is thought to drive the thermodynamics that concentrates CQ in the parasite DV.  Chloroquine-dependent heme accumulation in the DV may inhibit or kill the parasites.
<BR><BR> Unfortunately, certain Plasmodium strains have evolved resistance to CQ.  In fact, the spread of chloroquine-resistant (CQ.sup.R) Plasmodium parasites has rendered CQ almost useless for malaria treatment.  In addition, Plasmodium resistance to
other antimalarial drugs, such as artemisinin and its derivatives, has been reported (Xiao et al. 2004.  Parasitol.  Res.  92(3):215-219).  These are particularly devastating problems in many impoverished parts of the world where such drugs are most
needed (Krogstad.  1996.  Epidemiol.  Rev.  18(1):77-89).
<BR><BR> Plasmodium CQ.sup.R is correlated with mutations in the parasite's DV membrane transporter protein (PfCRT).  PfCRT is thought to enhance CQ export from the DV (Zhang et al. 2004.  Biochem.  43(26):8290-8296; Bennett et al. 2004.  Mol. Biochem. 
Parasitol.  133(1): 99-114; Martin and Kirk.  2004.  Mol. Biol.  Evol.  21(10): 1938-1949).  A particularly well-studied.  PfCRT mutation is K76T, which is correlated with CQ.sup.R (Martin and Kirk.  2004.  supra; Johnson et al. 2004.  Mol. Cell. 
15(6):867-877; Durrand et al. 2004.  Mol. Biochem.  Parasitol.  136(2):273-285; Ranjit et al. 2004.  Trop.  Med.  Int.  Health 9(8):857-861; Durand et al. 2002.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  46(8):2684-2686; Durand et al. 2001.  Mol. Biochem. 
Parasitol.  114(1):95-102; Cooper et al. 2002.  Mol. Pharmacol.  61(1):35-42; Djimde et al. 2001.  N. Engl.  J. Med.  344(4):257-263, 2001).
<BR><BR> Alternative therapies for treatment of chloroquine-resistant (CQ.sup.R) malaria parasites have been developed, including combination therapies (Kumar et al. 2003.  Curr.  Med.  Chem. 10(13):1137-1150).  However, none of these therapies meet CQ's
ease of use and low cost.
<BR><BR> One approach to treatment of CQ.sup.R parasites involves the use of chemicals known as "reversal agents." Reversal agents are chemicals that have been found to overcome CQ resistance (Krogstad et al., Science, 238(4831):1283-1285, 1987; Martin
et al., Science, 235(4791):899-901, 1987; Ryall, Parasitol, Today, 3(8):256, 1987); thus, making CQ.sup.R strains sensitive again to CQ.  CQ.sup.R reversal agents do not appear to have independent therapeutic value against Plasmodium as shown when a
therapeutically useful dose for CQ applied to a CQ.sup.S strain in the presence of a reversal agent is nearly the same as in the absence of the reversal agent.  However, despite their effectiveness against CQ.sup.R Plasmodium strains in vitro,
therapeutically effective doses of many reversal agents would have to be quite high (with associated side effects) to reverse CQ.sup.R in vivo (van Schalkwyk et al., Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother., 45(11):3171-3174, 2001; Millet et al., Antimicrob. 
Agents Chemother., 48(7):2753-2756, 2004).
<BR><BR> New compositions and methods for the treatment of malaria, particularly for the treatment of CQ.sup.R malaria parasites, are needed.

<BR><BR> Definitions
<BR><BR> Unless otherwise noted, terms are to be understood according to conventional usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.  For example, definitions of common terms in chemistry terms may be found in The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of
Chemical Terms, 1985, and The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 1981.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt which is acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable mammalian safety for a given dosage regime).  Such salts can be
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids.
<BR><BR> The term "salt thereof" means a compound formed when the hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a cation, such as a metal cation or an organic cation and the like or when a base is protonated with a hydrogen and accompanying anion, such as a
non-organic anion or an organic anion and the like.  In some embodiments, the salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, although this is not required for salts of intermediate compounds that are not intended for administration to a patient.
<BR><BR> The term "solvate" as used herein refers to a complex or aggregate formed by one or more molecules of a solute, i.e. a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and one or more molecules of a solvent.  Such
solvates are typically crystalline solids having a substantially fixed molar ratio of solute and solvent.  Representative solvents include by way of example, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid, and the like.  When the solvent is water,
the solvate formed is a hydrate.
<BR><BR> It will be appreciated that the term "or a salt or solvate or stereoisomer thereof" or "or salts or solvates or stereoisomers thereof" is intended to include all permutations of salts, solvates and stereoisomers, such as a solvate of a salt of a
stereoisomer of a compound of formula I.
<BR><BR> The term "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need of treatment.
<BR><BR> The term "treating" or "treatment" as used herein means the treating or treatment of a disease or medical condition in a subject, such as a mammal (including, for example, a human, a companion animal or a zoo animal) that includes: (a)
preventing the disease or medical condition from occurring, i.e., prophylactic treatment of a subject; (b) ameliorating the disease or medical condition, i.e., eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a subject; (c)
suppressing the disease or medical condition, i.e., slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a subject; or (d) alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical condition in a subject.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "subject" includes all animals, including humans and other animals, including, but not limited to, companion animals, farm animals and zoo animals.  The term "animal" can include any living multi-cellular vertebrate
organisms, a category that includes, for example, a mammal, a bird, a simian, a dog, a cat, a horse, a cow, a rodent, and the like.  Likewise, the term "mammal" includes both human and non-human mammals.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "optional" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not.  For
example, "heterocyclo group optionally mono- or di-substituted with an alkyl group" means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the heterocyclo group is mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and
situations where the heterocyclo group is not substituted with the alkyl group.
<BR><BR> It is further to be understood that any molecular weight or molecular mass values are approximate and are provided only for description.
<BR><BR> Except as otherwise noted, the methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and

<BR><BR> Characterization of MCQ Functional Properties
<BR><BR> The disclosed MCQ compounds are useful, at least, in the treatment of a disease or condition caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism, such as malaria or Plasmodium infection.  Without being bound by theory, CQ is believed to exert its
inhibitory effect on Plasmodium parasites by binding heme in the DV of the parasite.  Accordingly, if it is desirable to do so, non-limiting methods useful to functionally characterize MCQ compounds are heme binding assays and in vitro and in vivo
Plasmodium bioassays.
<BR><BR> 1.  Heme Binding
<BR><BR> Optionally, heme binding of MCQ compounds can be determined by any method known in the art, including, for example, spectrophotometric methods, like UV-VIS spectroscopy or NMR spectroscopy.  Methods of measuring heme binding to a variety of
molecules using the UV-VIS spectrum have been described (see, e.g., Xu et al. 2001.  J. Inorg.  Biochem.  86(2-3):617-625; Xu et al. 2002.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother, 46(1):144-150, each of the foregoing which is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety).  Generally, a heme-binding compound (such as a disclosed MCQ) is mixed in increasing concentration with heme (or a heme model compound, such as porphyrin or metalloporphyrin), and the absorbance spectrum is measured from the ultraviolet
region well into the visible region (from about 300 nm to about 750 nm).  This spectral range includes the so-called Soret and Q-band regions that arise from porphyrin or metalloporphyrin absorbance.  Upon interaction between a heme-binding compound and
heme (or a heme model compound, such as porphyrin or metalloporphyrin), decreased absorbance in the Soret region is observed.  Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such decrease arises from pi-pi stacking interactions (White, Aggregation of
porphyrins and metalloporphyrins, In: The Porphyrins.  ed.  by Dolphin, NewYork: Academic Press, 1978, pp.  303-339).
<BR><BR> The formation of heme-MCQ complexes can be determined by UV-VIS spectrophotometric titration, using a variety of commercially available spectrophotometers (such as a Varian-Cary 3E spectrophotometer).  The approximate pH of the plasmodial DV,
where CQ (or MCQ) is believed to bind to heme in vivo, is pH 4.7; thus, it is useful (though not obligatory) to conduct heme-binding reactions at a pH (e.g., 4.7 or 7) and temperature (e.g., 25.degree.  C.) similar to DV conditions in vivo.  Titrations
of heme (or a heme model) with a MCQ compound can be performed, for example, by successive addition of aliquots of a 1 mM MCQ solution to a 10 .mu.M heme solution.  Optionally, pH can be monitored throughout the procedure to ensure that it remains
unchanged.  In some circumstances, UV-VIS spectral data can be analyzed digitally, and absorbance readings and concentrations corrected for dilution effects.  The amount of heme-MCQ complex versus amount of MCQ added to the reaction can be plotted.  Such
titration curves can be analyzed with Hill plot and non-linear curve fitting methods as described previously (Xu et al. 2002.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  46(1):144-150) to obtain association constants for the heme-MCQ binding reaction.
<BR><BR> NMR is another optional method that can be used, for example, to provide information about stoichiometry, interaction affinities, and structural details of complexes between MCQ molecules and heme (or heme models, such porphyrins or
metalloporphyrins) (White.  Aggregation of porphyrins and metalloporphyrins, In: The Porphyrins.  ed.  by Dolphin, NewYork: Academic Press, 1978, pp.  303-339).
<BR><BR> NMR parameters useful to measure include changes in chemical shift, line-width, and relaxation times.  For example, NNM relaxation times give information about proximity to paramagnetic centers (e.g., the Fe in heme), or chemical exchange
between species (e.g., bound and free MCQ).  A fourth useful parameter to measure is peak area ratio, which is convenient if exchange between complexes is unexpectedly slow.  NMR studies can be performed by adding aliquots of heme to MCQ solutions, then
monitoring chemical shifts, linewidths, and relaxation times of the MCQ NMR signals.  Such techniques are well known in the art (see, for instance, Xu et al. 2001.  J. Inorg.  Biochem.  86(2-3):617-625).
<BR><BR> If desirable, fluorescence confocal microscopy can also be used to determine whether an MCQ is localized to the DV (see, for instance, Xu et al. 2002.  Mol. Biochem.  Parasitol.  123(1):47-54, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety).
<BR><BR> 2.  In Vitro and In Vivo Bioassays
<BR><BR> One exemplary method for measuring inhibitory effects of MCQ compound in vitro has been reported by Smilkstein et al. (2004.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  48(5):1803-1806, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).  This
method employs fluorescent detection of the level of parasitemia in cultured red blood cells and can be automated for high-throughput screening of antimalarial RCQs.  This exemplary method allows the inhibitory agent (such as a MCQ) to be in contact with
the parasite for an entire developmental cycle without purine starvation, which is in contrast to the traditional .sup.3H-hypoxanthine method (Desjardins et al. 1979.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  16(6):710-718, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety).  Briefly, to perform the Smilkstein et al. method, an initial parasitemia of approximately 0.2% is attained by adding uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) to a stock culture of Plasmodium-infected RBCs.  Infected cells (2% v/v)
are combined with RCQs (for example, dissolved in DMSO), e.g., at a final concentration of 10.sup.-1 to 10.sup.-4 M. Chloroquine can be added (instead of a MCQ) to some infected RBCs as a control.  After a period of incubation (such as about 72 hours), a
sufficient amount (e.g., 100 .mu.L) of a fluorescent DNA binding dye-detergent mixture (e.g., Sybr Green I dye-detergent mixture) to lyse cells and bind to DNA is added to the reactions.  Because uninfected RBCs have no DNA, only parasite DNA (in
infected RBCs) is available for binding to the fluorescent dye (e.g., Sybr Green I).  Samples are then incubated in the dark for a period of time (e.g., one hour), followed by measurement of levels of fluorescence.  For Sybr Green 1, excitation and
emission wavelength are 485 and 530 nm, respectively.  Fluorescence readings, which represent the amount of parasite DNA in the sample, can be plotted against the Log [drug] and fit to a curve by nonlinear regression to obtain the IC.sub.50 value for the
tested compound.
<BR><BR> Various Plasmodium parasites are available for testing in vitro efficacy of antimalarial compounds (such as a disclosed MCQ).  The disclosed MCQ can be effective against CQ.sup.R and/or CQ.sup.S Plasmodium strains (such as CQ.sup.R and CQ.sup.S
P. falciparum strains).  Exemplary CQ.sup.S and CQ.sup.R P. falciparum strains are shown in the following table;
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Drug Susceptibility of P. falciparum strain P. falciparum strain Drug D6 FCR3 W2 Dd2 3D7 TM91C235 7G8 CQ S R R R S R R Quinine S S R R NC R Mefloquine S/R S S R NC R Pyrimethamine S S R R NC R Cycloguanil S S R S NC NC
Sulfadoxine S S R S NC R S = sensitive; R = resistant; S/R = intermediate level of resistance; NC = not characterized
<BR><BR> Antimalarial compounds can also be tested for efficacy in vivo.  One non-limiting exemplary method for performing such testing is the 4-day suppressive test (Peters.  1975.  Ann.  Trop.  Med.  Parasitol.  69(2):155-171, which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety).  Briefly, such test involves collecting P. chabaudi (Mackinnon and Read.  2004.  Philos.  Trans.  R. Soc.  Lond.  B Biol.  Sci.  359:965-986; Mackinnon et al. 2002.  Exp.  Parasitol.  101(2-3):121-128, each of which
is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) from a donor animal harboring about 20% parasitemia.  Male CF-1 mice at 4-5 weeks of age (about 20 g) are infected with about 10.sup.7 infected red blood cells via 100 .mu.L tail vein injection and
randomly sorted into groups of 4 mice each on Day 0.  One hour after infection, the mice receive the test agent via oral gavage, or by the intraperitoneal route (at approximately 1-10 times the in vitro IC.sub.50 values).  Drugs are administered once
daily for at least 4 days beginning at Day 0.  Animals are tested weekly for levels of parasitemia, for example, by microscopic analysis of Giemsa-stained blood smears.  Efficacy of a tested compound in this bioassay is measured by inhibition of parasite
growth as defined previously.  In some examples, subjects are expected to be freed of measurable parasites after a period of treatment (such as 30 days).

<BR><BR> Many general references providing commonly known chemical synthetic schemes and conditions useful for synthesizing the disclosed compounds are available (see, e.g., Smith and March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and
Structure, Fifth Edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2001; or Vogel, A Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, Including Qualitative Organic Analysis, Fourth Edition, New York: Longman, 1978).
<BR><BR> Compounds as described herein can be purified by any of the means known in the art, including chromatographic means, such as HPLC, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash column chromatography and ion exchange chromatography.  Any suitable
stationary phase can be used, including normal and reversed phases as well as ionic resins.  Most typically the disclosed compounds are purified via silica gel and/or alumina chromatography.  See, e.g., Introduction to Modern Liquid Chromatography, 2nd
Edition, ed.  L. R. Snyder and J. J. Kirkland, John Wiley and Sons, 1979; and Thin Layer Chromatography, ed E. Stahl, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1969.
<BR><BR> A representative synthesis for compounds of formula I is shown in FIG. 1.  In FIG. 1, with parameters defined herein, Compound 100 is reacted with Compound 101 to give Compound 102.  In Compound 100, X.sup.10 is a leaving group.  Examples of
suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen, mesylate, tosylate, or triflate.  In Compound 101, b is an integer from 1 to 12, thus forming an alkylene chain.  The alkylene chain can be optionally substituted according to the
disclosure herein.  Compound 100 and 101 react in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to give Compound 102.  The nucleophilic substitution reaction can be run neatly or with a suitable solvent.  The nucleophilic reaction can be run at various
temperatures, including with cooling, at room temperature, or with heating.  One skilled in the art would be able to determine suitable reaction conditions according to the specific reactants.
<BR><BR> The hydroxyl group of Compound 102 is then converted to an activated leaving group to give Compound 103.  In Compound 103, --O-LG represents an activated leaving group.  The carbon atom attached to an activated leaving group is susceptible to
nucleophilic attack or readily eliminates.  Conversion of the hydroxyl group to an activated leaving group can be performed by various methods.  In certain methods, the hydroxyl group is converted to an alkyl sulfonate or aryl sulfonate, such as
mesylate, tosylate, and triflate.
<BR><BR> The activated leaving group of Compound 103 is reacted with a nucleophilic amino group of Compound 104 to give Compound 105 through a nucleophilic substitution reaction.  In Compound 103, --O-LG is a leaving group.  Examples of suitable leaving
groups include, but not limited to, mesylate, tosylate, or triflate.  In Compound 104, L is an alkylene or substituted alkylene chain, such as L.sup.2 or L.sup.3, as defined herein.  The alkylene chain can be optionally substituted according to the
disclosure herein.  Compound 103 and 104 react in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to give Compound 105.  The nucleophilic substitution reaction can be run neatly or with a suitable solvent.  The nucleophilic reaction can be run at various
temperatures, including with cooling, at room temperature, or with heating.  One skilled in the art would be able to determine suitable reaction conditions according to the specific reactants.
<BR><BR> The secondary amine on Compound 105 can be derivatized to form Compound 106 with R.sup.1 group.  Examples of further derivatization of Compound 105 to provide Compound 106 include, but are not limited to: the amine can be reacted with aldehydes
or ketones in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride to reductively alkylate the amine; with acid chlorides or carboxylic acids and an amide bond forming reagent to form amides; and with sulfonyl chlorides to form
sulfonamides.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical Compositions
<BR><BR> The disclosed MCQ compounds are useful for the inhibition and treatment of diseases or conditions caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism.  The disclosed MCQ compounds are useful for the treatment of malaria and/or inhibiting the growth of
malarial parasites, such as P. falciparum.  Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one disclosed MCQ compound are also described herein.
<BR><BR> A pharmaceutical composition comprising an MCQ compound can be administered to a subject alone, or in combination with other supplementary active agents.  The pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured using any of a variety of processes,
including, without limitation, conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, and lyophilizing.  The pharmaceutical composition can take any of a variety of forms including, without
limitation, a sterile solution, suspension, emulsion, lyophilisate, tablet, pill, pellet, capsule, powder, syrup, elixir or any other dosage form suitable for administration.
<BR><BR> A subject MCQ compound can be administered to a subject using any convenient means capable of resulting in the desired reduction in disease condition or symptom.  Thus, a subject MCQ compound can be incorporated into a variety of formulations
for therapeutic administration.  More particularly, a subject MCQ compound can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and can be formulated into preparations in
solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols.
<BR><BR> Formulations for pharmaceutical compositions are well known in the art.  For example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975, describes exemplary formulations (and components
thereof) suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of disclosed MCQ compounds.  Pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of the disclosed MCQ compounds can be formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine.  Particular formulations of a
disclosed pharmaceutical composition can depend, for example, on the mode of administration (e.g., oral or parenteral) and/or on the location of the infection to be treated (e.g., liver-stage and/or blood-stage malaria parasites).  In some embodiments,
formulations include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in addition to at least one active ingredient, such as a MCQ compound.  In other embodiments, other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, for example, with similar, related or complementary effects
on the affliction being treated (such as malaria or Plasmodium infection), can also be included as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful for the disclosed methods and compositions are conventional in the art.  The nature of a pharmaceutical carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed.  For example,
parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle.  For solid
compositions (e.g., powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate.  In addition to biologically neutral carriers,
pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can optionally contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances (e.g., excipients), such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like; for example, sodium
acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.  Other non-limiting excipients include, nonionic solubilizers, such as cremophor, or proteins, such as human serum albumin or plasma preparations.
<BR><BR> Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil,
olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as
magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) buffered solutions; (21) polyesters, polycarbonates and/or polyanhydrides; and (22) other
non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.
<BR><BR> The disclosed pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a disclosed MCQ compound.  Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are non-toxic salts of a free base form of a compound that possesses the desired
pharmacological activity of the free base.  These salts can be derived from inorganic or organic acids.  Non-limiting examples of suitable inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, hydriodic acid, and phosphoric
acid.  Non-limiting examples of suitable organic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid,
mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methyl sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, gluconic acid, asparagic acid, aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid,
p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, and the like.  Lists of other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985.  A pharmaceutically
acceptable salt can also serve to adjust the osmotic pressure of the composition.
<BR><BR> An MCQ compound can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to provide oral formulations, which may be in any suitable form (e.g., liquid formulations, tablets, powders, granules or capsules, and the like).  Tablets, powders,
granules or capsules can be produced, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with
disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.
<BR><BR> An MCQ compound can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher
aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.  The preparation can also be emulsified or the active ingredient
encapsulated in liposome vehicles.  Formulations suitable for injection can be administered by an intravitreal, intraocular, intramuscular, subcutaneous, sublingual, or other route of administration, e.g., injection into the gum tissue or other oral
tissue.  Such formulations are also suitable for topical administration.
<BR><BR> Certain embodiments of the pharmaceutical compositions comprising a disclosed MCQ compound can be formulated in unit dosage form suitable for individual administration of precise dosages.  The amount of active ingredient (e.g., MCQ compound)
administered will depend on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, and the manner of administration, and is known to those skilled in the art.  Within these bounds, the formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of the
extracts or compounds disclosed herein in an amount effective to achieve the desired effect in the subject being treated.

<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical composition can further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.  Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, sweeteners, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring
agents.  Such excipients are known in the art.  Examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences at pages 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19.sup.th ed.  1995), which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.

<BR><BR> Furthermore, a subject MCQ compound can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases.  A subject MCQ compound can be administered rectally via a suppository.  The suppository can
include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.
<BR><BR> The term "unit dosage form," as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of an MCQ compound calculated in an amount sufficient to
produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle.  The specifications for a subject MCQ compound depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics
associated with each compound in the host.
<BR><BR> The dosage form of a disclosed pharmaceutical composition will be determined by the mode of administration chosen.  For example, in addition to injectable fluids, topical or oral dosage forms can be employed.  Topical preparations can include
eye drops, ointments, sprays and the like.  Oral formulations can be liquid (e.g., syrups, solutions or suspensions), or solid (e.g., powders, pills, tablets, or capsules).  Methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those
skilled in the art.
<BR><BR> Certain embodiments of the pharmaceutical compositions comprising a disclosed MCQ compound can be formulated in unit dosage form suitable for individual administration of precise dosages.  The amount of such a MCQ compound administered will
depend on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, and the manner of administration, and is known to those skilled in the art.  Within these bounds, the formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of the compounds disclosed
herein in an amount effective to achieve the desired effect in the subject being treated.
<BR><BR> Methods of Use
<BR><BR> The present disclosure includes methods of inhibiting or treating a disease or condition caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism.  CQ-susceptible microorganisms are microorganisms which exhibit reduced growth in the presence of CQ. 
CQ-susceptible microorganisms can include microorganisms classified as CQ sensitive or CQ resistant.  "CQ sensitive" (or "CQS") and "CQ resistant" (or "CQR") as used herein generally refer to the relative susceptibility of microorganism strains to growth
inhibition by CQ.  Thus "CQR microorganisms" can exhibit CQ-mediated growth inhibition, but require a higher dose than required for a similar level of growth inhibition of a CQ sensitive strain of the same microorganism.
<BR><BR> Methods of assessing the effect of CQ on growth of a microorganism can be accomplished using methods well known in the art.  For example, CQ-susceptibility of a microorganism can be assessed by comparing growth of the microorganism in the
presence and absence of CQ wherein the microorganism tested is cultured under suitable conditions or is present in an animal model.  Susceptibility of a microorganism to treatment using a compound of the present disclosure can also be assessed by
comparing growth of the microorganism in the presence and absence of one or more compounds of the present disclosure wherein the microorganism tested is cultured under suitable conditions or is present in an animal model.  Exemplary CQ-susceptible
microorganisms include those that exhibit reduced growth in the presence of up to 100 .mu.M chloroquine.  In certain cases, CQ-susceptible microorganisms are those that exhibit reduced growth in the presence of up to 50 .mu.M chloroquine exhibit reduced
growth in the presence of CQ in the nM range or in the pM range.
<BR><BR> In certain cases, the CQ-susceptible microorganism is a Plasmodium parasite such as a CQR or CQS strain.  CQ-susceptible microorganisms include microorganisms in which CQ reduces the ability of the microorganism to detoxify heme detoxification
and/or which facilitate growth inhibition by increasing pH of organelles of the microorganism.
<BR><BR> Embodiments of the invention relate to methods of treating malaria and/or inhibiting Plasmodium parasite growth (including CQ.sup.R and CQ.sup.S parasites).  Examples of pathogens whose growth can be inhibited include, but are not limited to, P.
falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovate, P. malariae, including combinations thereof.  In other examples, the disease or Plasmodium parasite to be treated is resistant to CQ or other traditional malaria treatment.
<BR><BR> Disclosed methods includes administering a disclosed MCQ compound (and, optionally, one or more other pharmaceutical agents) to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in an amount effective to inhibit or treat a disease or
condition caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism.  The treatment can be used prophylactically in any subject in a demographic group at substantial risk for such diseases; for example, subjects who are traveling to areas where malaria (such as CQ.sup.R
malaria) is endemic (including, e.g., Southeast Asia, Africa, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Thailand, and India).  Notably, pregnant women are twice as likely to attract malaria-carrying mosquitoes as non-pregnant women (perhaps due to a greater volume of
exhaled air and a warmer skin surface), and, therefore, are especially vulnerable to malaria.  Alternatively, subjects can be selected using more specific criteria, such as a probable or definitive diagnosis of malaria or Plasmodium infection based on,
for example, clinical signs and symptoms and/or laboratory evidence of parasite infection.  An example of such a subject is a person who presents clinically with symptoms resembling the flu (including periods of chills and fever lasting several hours and
occurring every few days).  In more severe cases, an infected subject can present with enlarged spleen and/or liver, anemia, and jaundice.  Other subjects can be identified based on positive tests for parasite-specific proteins, including plasmodial
histidine rich protein-2 (HRP-2) or parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (PLDH) or parasite DNA.  A number of antibodies specific for Plasmodium parasites are available and are useful for diagnostic immunoassays or immunofluorescence techniques.  PCR
can also be used to diagnosis malaria in a subject (Am.  J. Trap.  Med.  Hyg., 65(4):355-363, 2001).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the MCQ compound, or a pharmaceutical composition containing the same, is administered to a subject in which a disease or condition has developed, wherein the disease or condition is caused by a microorganism formerly
susceptible but currently resistant to chloroquine.  In such embodiments, the MCQ compound, or pharmaceutical composition containing the same, is used to treat the disease or condition in which chloroquine has been found to be less effective or not
effective.  In some embodiments, chloroquine is about 10-fold less effective than the MCQ compound.  In some embodiments, chloroquine is about 20-fold less effective than the MCQ compound.  In some embodiments, chloroquine is about 25-fold, 50-fold,
100-fold or more less effective than the MCQ compound.
<BR><BR> Disclosed methods also includes administering a disclosed MCQ compound to a subject in need thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to inhibit or treat diseases or conditions caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism.
<BR><BR> Routes of administration useful in the disclosed methods include but are not limited to oral and parenteral routes, such as intravenous (iv), intraperitoneal (ip), rectal, topical, ophthalmic, nasal, and transdermal.  Formulations for these
dosage forms are described herein.
<BR><BR> An effective amount of a MCQ will depend, at least, on the particular method of use, the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, and the manner of administration of the therapeutic composition.  A "therapeutically effective
amount" of a composition is a quantity of a specified compound sufficient to achieve a desired effect in a subject (host) being treated.  For example, this can be the amount of a MCQ necessary to prevent, inhibit, reduce or relieve a disease or condition
caused by a CQ-susceptible microorganism, such as a Plasmodium infection or malaria.  Ideally, a therapeutically effective amount of a MCQ is an amount sufficient to prevent, inhibit, reduce or relieve a disease or condition caused by a CQ-susceptible
microorganism without causing a substantial cytotoxic effect on host cells.  It is believed that disclosed MCQs will be well tolerated in human subjects because, at least some, quinoline analogs (such as CQ) have been demonstrated safe for administration
to human subjects in therapies.
<BR><BR> Therapeutically effective doses (growth inhibitory amounts) of a disclosed MCQ compound or pharmaceutical composition can be determined by one of skill in the art, with a goal of achieving local (e.g., tissue) concentrations that are at least as
high as the IC.sub.50 of the applicable compound disclosed in the examples herein.  The effective amount administered to the subject depends on a variety of factors including, but not limited to the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the
subject being treated, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the activity of the specific MCQ compound being administered, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, mode and time of administration, rate of
excretion and the drug combination.  The amount of the pharmaceutical composition that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a condition, such as malaria, can be determined by standard clinical techniques well known to those of skill in the art. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges.  One of ordinary skill in the art will readily be able to determine the precise dose to be employed.  Suitable effective dosage amounts, however,
typically range from about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight to about 250 mg/kg of body weight, from about 0.25 mg/kg of body weight to about 200 mg/kg of body weight, from about 0.5 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight, from about 0.75 mg/kg of
body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight, or from about 1 mg/kg of body weight to about 25 mg/kg of body weight.  The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amount of MCQ compound administered.  For example, if more than one MCQ
compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount of MCQ compound administered.
<BR><BR> An example of a dosage range is from about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg body weight administered orally in single or divided doses.  In particular examples, an oral dosage range is from about 1.0 to about 100 mg/kg body weight administered orally in
single or divided doses, including from about 1.0 to about 50 mg/kg body weight, from about 1.0 to about 25 mg/kg body weight, from about 1.0 to about 10 mg/kg body weight (assuming an average body weight of approximately 70 kg; values adjusted
accordingly for persons weighing more or less than average).  For oral administration, the compositions are, for example, provided in the form of a tablet containing from about 50 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient, particularly about 75 mg, about
100 mg, about 200 mg, about 400 mg, about 500 mg, about 600 mg, about 750 mg, or about 1000 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject being treated.  In one exemplary oral dosage regimen, a tablet containing
from about 500 mg to about 1000 mg active ingredient is administered once (e.g., a loading dose) followed by administration of 1/2 dosage tablets (e.g., from about 250 to about 500 mg) each 6 to 24 hours for at least 3 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered parenterally.  In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered subcutaneously.  In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be
administered intravenously, in some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered orally.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered by injection, which includes, but is not limited to, the following means of delivery: intradermal; intramuscular; intraperitoneal; intravenous; and subcutaneous.
<BR><BR> In practicing the subject methods, a subject can be administered a single dose or two or more doses over a given period of time.  For example, over a given treatment period of one month, 1 or more doses, such as 2 or more doses, 3 or more doses,
4 or more doses, 5 or more doses, etc., can be administered to the subject, where the doses can be administered weekly or daily or even multiple times per day.
<BR><BR> The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject can be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific MCQ compound, the metabolic stability and length of action of that
compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the condition of the host undergoing therapy.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered once per day until 2-3 days after cessation of the condition.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as two doses per day until 2-3 days after cessation of the condition.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered once per day for from about 1 to about 10 days.  For example, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition can be administered once per day for
about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as two doses per day for from about 1 to about 10 days.  For example, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition can be administered as two
doses per day for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered once per day for about 14 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as two doses per day for about 14 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered once per day for about 21 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition is administered as two doses per day for about 21 days.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, to treat some conditions, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered for even longer periods of time, for example several months.
<BR><BR> Embodiments of the invention also relate to combinations of one or more disclosed MCQs with one or more other agents or therapies useful in the treatment of malaria and/or Plasmodium parasitemia.  For example, one or more disclosed MCQs can be
administered in combination with effective doses of other medicinal and pharmaceutical agents, or in combination other non-medicinal therapies, such as hormone or radiation therapy.  The term "administration in combination with" refers to both concurrent
and sequential administration of the active agents.  In some examples, the one or more other antimalarial agents or therapies can include artesunate and mefloquine (either individually or in an artesunate-mefloquine combination), or sulfadoxine and
pyrimethamine (either individually or in a sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination (commercially available as Fanisdar.TM.)).  In particular examples, the one or more other antimalarial agents or therapies have at least one different mode of action than is
proposed (although not binding) for a disclosed MCQ; thus, for instance, a combination agent or therapy can target mitochondria and/or dihydrofolate reductase.  In another example, two or more MCQs could be administered together.
<BR><BR> Furthermore, the effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amount of MCQ compound administered.  For example, if more than one MCQ compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount of MCQ
compound administered.
<BR><BR> Other method embodiments involve inhibiting the growth of at least one Plasmodium (such as P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae, or a combination thereof) by contacting the parasite(s) with a growth inhibitory amount of a disclosed
MCQ.  Contact between a MCQ and a parasite may occur in vitro (such as in culture conditions or treatment of blood ex vivo) or in vivo (such as in a subject infected with at least one Plasmodium).  A growth inhibitory amount is from about 1 nM to about 1
.mu.M of a disclosed MCQ (such as from about 5 nM to about 50 nM, or from about 5 nM to about 25 nM).
<BR><BR> Research Applications
<BR><BR> Since the compounds can inhibit growth of CQ-susceptible microorganisms, such compounds are also useful as research tools.  Accordingly, embodiments of the invention are directed to a method for using a compound of formula I or a salt or solvate
or stereoisomer thereof as a research tool for studying a biological system or sample, or for discovering new chemical compounds that can inhibit the growth of a CQ-susceptible microorganism.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a method of studying a biological system or sample known to comprise a CQ-susceptible microorganism is provided, the method comprising: (a) contacting the biological system or sample with a compound of formula I or a salt or
solvate or stereoisomer thereof; and (b) determining the inhibiting effects caused by the compound on the biological system or sample.
<BR><BR> Any suitable biological system or sample having a CQ-susceptible microorganism can be employed in such studies which can be conducted either in vitro or in vivo.  Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include,
but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the subject compounds are provided as additives for storage of blood and blood products.  Blood products include whole blood, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, serum and plasma.  The amount of subject compound
added to the blood or blood product is an effective amount to inhibit growth of a CQ-susceptible microorganism.
<BR><BR> When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising a CQ-susceptible microorganism is typically contacted with an inhibiting amount of a subject compound.  After the biological system or sample is exposed to the compound, the
effects of inhibition of a CQ-susceptible microorganism are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by home binding assay or in vitro and in vivo bioassays.  Exposure encompasses contacting the biological system or sample with the
compound or administering the compound to a subject.  The determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis).  Measuring a response involves, for example, determining
the effects of the compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and measuring ligand-mediated changes in functional assays.  The assay results can be used to determine the
activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, a CQ-susceptible microorganism-inhibiting amount.
<BR><BR> Additionally, the subject compounds can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having a CQ-susceptible microorganism-inhibiting
activity.  In this manner, a subject compound is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with the subject compounds to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity,
if any.  For example, IC.sub.50 data for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the IC.sub.50 data for a subject compound to identify those test compounds that have the desired properties, for example, test compounds having an
IC.sub.50 about equal or superior to a subject compound, if any.
<BR><BR> This aspect includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of test data to identify test compounds of interest.  Thus, a test compound can be evaluated in a biological
assay, by a method comprising the steps of: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a subject compound to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted
either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b) to generate comparison data.  The biological assay can be selected from CQ-susceptible
microorganism-inhibition, Plasmodium-inhibition, cytotoxity, and bioavailability.  An exemplary biological assay includes a fluorescence assay for determining IC.sub.50 of antimalarial drugs, such as using CQ-susceptible microorganism or Plasmodium.

<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR> Assay Against CQ.sup.R and CQ.sup.S P. Falciparum Strains
<BR><BR> This Example demonstrates that several representative compounds are highly effective inhibitors of the growth of CQ.sup.R and CQ.sup.S P. falciparum strains in vitro.
<BR><BR> An in vitro fluorescence assay for determining IC.sub.50 of antimalarial drugs was performed as previously described by Smilkstein et al. (2004.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  48(5):1803-1806).  This procedure can be automated for
high-throughput screening of the antimalarial activities of RCQs described herein.  This method also allows the tested agent (e.g., a MCQ) to be in contact with the parasite for an entire developmental cycle without purine starvation (which occurs with
the commonly used .sup.3H-hypoxanthine method; see, e.g., Desjardins et al. 1979.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  16, (6):710-7188).
<BR><BR> Briefly, an initial parasitemia of approximately 0.2% was attained by addition of uninfected red blood cells to a stock culture of cells infected with Dd2 (CQ.sup.R), 7G8 (CQ.sup.R), or D6 (CQ.sup.S) P. falciparum strains.  A 10 mM solution of a
test compound (in DMSO) was prepared.  The test compound (at a final concentration from 10.sup.-11 to 10.sup.-4 M) and infected red blood cells (at a final concentration of 2% (v/v)) were mixed in 100 .mu.L samples in individual wells of a 96-well plate. Each sample was prepared in triplicate.  A triplicate set of reactions containing CQ (instead of the test compound) was included as a control.  After a 72 hour incubation period, Sybr Green I dye-detergent mixture (100 .mu.L) was added to each reaction. 
The samples were further incubated for an hour in the dark, and then placed in a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Gemini-EM, Molecular Diagnostics) and analyzed with excitation and emission wavelength bands at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. 
Fluorescence readings were plotted against the Log [drug], and curve fitting performed by nonlinear regression to find the IC.sub.50 value.
<BR><BR> IC.sub.50 values were calculated from these data and are summarized in the following Table 3:

<BR><BR>Cytotoxicity Assay
<BR><BR> MCQ cytotoxicity was determined against mitogen-induced marine spleen lymphocytes in vitro using the Alamar Blue assay (as described by Ahmed et al. 1994.  J. Immunol.  Meth.  170(2):211-224, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety).  Mouse spleen lymphocytes were isolated from C57B1/6J mice by teasing tissues on a metallic sieve screen.  Cells thus obtained were washed in RPMI 1640 media, then resuspended in complete RPMI media containing 10% FBS, 50 .mu.g/ml
penicillin/streptomycin, 50 .mu.M .beta.-mercaptoethanol, and 1 .mu.M/mL concanavalin A for 1 minute.  Two hundred (200) .mu.l isolated cells were then seeded in separate wells of a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate at a density of
2.times.10.sup.5 cells per well.  Test compound was added to the individual wells at concentrations of 0 to 62 .mu.M.  After 72 hours incubation in a humidified atmosphere at 37.degree.  C. and 5% CO.sub.2, a solution of resazurin PBS was added to a
final concentration 10 .mu.M, and the plates were returned to the incubator for another 24 hours.  Resazurin is a substrate which changes color in response to metabolic activity (such as that found in living cells).  The fluorescence of the
cell-containing samples was measured with a Gemini EM plate reader with excitation at 560 nM and emission at 590 nM.  LC.sub.50 values were determined from plots of florescence versus drug concentration using non-linear regression by Prism software.

<BR><BR>In Vivo Activity
<BR><BR> Compounds were tested in mice against P. berghei according to procedure disclosed here in the In Vitro and In Vivo Bioassays Section.
<BR><BR> According to the In Vitro and In Vivo Bioassays section, male CF-1 mice at 4-5 weeks of age (about 20 g) are infected with about 10.sup.7 infected red blood cells via 100 .mu.L, tail vein injection and randomly sorted into groups of 4 mice each
on Day 0.  One hour after infection, the mice receive the test agent via oral gavage, or by the intraperitoneal route (at approximately 1-10 times the in vitro IC.sub.50 values).  Drugs are administered once daily for at least 4 days beginning at Day 0. 
Animals are tested weekly for levels of parasitemia, for example, by microscopic analysis of Giemsa-stained blood smears.  Efficacy of a tested compound in this bioassay is measured by inhibition of parasite growth as defined previously.  In some
examples, subjects are expected to be freed of measurable parasites after a period of treatment (such as 30 days).
<BR><BR> Compounds were tested according to four variations of the procedure: single oral dose, single subcutaneous dose, first 4.times.  oral dose experiment, and second 4.times.  oral dose experiment.  For the single oral dose, single subcutaneous
dose, and the first 4.times.  oral dose experiments, the dosage was 30 mg/kg.  In the second 4.times.  oral dose experiment, the dosage of each test drug was adjusted to an amount equimolar to 30 mg/kg CQ.
<BR><BR> The mice were monitored for survival up to 30 days and for parasitemia, which was very low, if any.  Historical CQ data is provided for comparison.  For CQ, the average survival for the mice in 1) single oral dose: 9 days; 2) single subcutaneous
dose: 10 days; 3) first 4.times.  oral dose experiment: 30 days; and 4) second 4.times.  oral dose experiment: 30 days.  A negative control was run.  The results for the negative control is as follows: 1) single oral dose; 4 days; 2) single subcutaneous
dose: 4 days; and 3) first 4.times.  oral dose experiment: 4 days.
<BR><BR> 7-chloro-N-(3-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)quinolin-4-amine was tested.  The average survival for the mice tested with 7-chloro-N-(3-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)quinolin-4-amine in the second 4.times.  oral dose experiment
was 20 days.
