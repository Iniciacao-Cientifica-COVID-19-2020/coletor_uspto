       <p>Calcium (Ca.sup.2+) channel blockers, such as nifedipine and <B><I>verapamil,</I></B> are
     used in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases such as stroke and
     peripheral vascular occlusive diseases, especially arterial and venous
     thrombosis, vasculitis, myelofibrosis disease and hemolytic anemias. Such
     diseases arise from platelet hyperactivation and the Ca.sup.2+ channel
     blockers restore the platelets to their normal aggregation
     characteristics. Diagnostic procedures for detecting platelet
     hyperactivation and defective calcium handling/transport indicative of
     certain peripheral obstructive diseases using chlorotetracycline as a
     detectable fluorescent probe as a means of assessing a patient's response
     to Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers in the therapy of such diseases are also
     described.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Current Therapy for Vascular Occlusive Diseases: Thrombosis and many related peripheral obstructive diseases are the result of abnormal activation of normal clotting mechanisms.  Normal blood clotting is the result of a highly amplified chain
reaction triggered by exposure of soluble factors and platelets to tissue factors, collagen and certain metabolites or hormones such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adrenaline and thromboxane.  The clotting mechanism makes use of two systems: (a) soluble
factors in the blood which activate each other in a serial manner causing hydrolysis of fibrinogen to fibrin which forms an insoluble crosslinked network, and (b) the circulating thrombocytes (platelets) which respond to the activating stimuli by
releasing their own activators and by aggregating with each other.  In normal clotting the soluble and platelet systems interact, with activation of one reinforcing the activation of the other.  Abnormal activation of these systems can give rise to
peripheral obstructive diseases.  . While the pathogenesis is very complex, current models involve a lesion of the vein or artery wall, local activation of the clotting system, recruitment of activated soluble factors and platelets into the region,
homeostasis, local ischemia, and reinforced activation recruitment.
<BR><BR>The platelet plays a central role in the formation and extension of clot in both venous and arterial thrombosis.  In venous thrombosis, the activation of platelet initiates shape changes and release reactions of platelet contents such ADP,
arachidonic acid derivatives, clotting factors which promote platelet recruitment and aggregation and activate coagulation cascade leading to fibrin formation.  The activated platelet also provides an activated surface (platelet factor III) which serves
as a binding site for soluble clotting factors thereby increasing their interaction and further accelerating the rate of fibrin formation.
<BR><BR>Current therapy for venous thrombosis relies mainly on the inhibition of fibrin formation; little attention was given to inhibition of the platelet which plays central role in activation.  Conventional therapy for venous thrombosis makes use of
heparin which actively neutralizes several of the activated soluble clotting factors.  Conventional therapy also makes use of the so-called "oral anticoagulants" (dicumarol and related compounds) which inhibit the synthesis of these factors.  Direct
platelet activation is not affected by these drugs.  In arterial thrombosis, platelets adhere to injured or diseased vessel wall and transform their shapes, release ADP and other platelet granule content, convert arachidonic acid to thromboxane A.sub.2,
which promotes more platelet aggregation and vasconstriction and consolidation of platelet plugs.  The use of antiplatelet drugs is, therefore, the mainstay of treatment and prevention of arterial thrombosis.  Two classes of drug target the platelet and
are used to treat arterial thrombosis: aspirin and dipyridamole.  Aspirin inhibits the activation of arachidonic acid, which is one of the pathways for platelet activation.  This offers some protection against activation.  Dipyridamole is a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor which increases the platelets' cyclic AMP level.  This offers further protection against activation.
<BR><BR>Extensive clinical trials on the use of these agents in arterial thombosis showed minimal therapeutic effects.
<BR><BR>Ca.sup.2+ Entry Blockers Are Effective Anticoagulants: The above information suggests that it would be useful to be able to further inhibit the platelet contribution to the aggregation process.  The present invention shows that increases in
cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ concentration are central to the activation process.  For instance, it has been demonstrated that platelets from patients with peripheral obstructive diseases have defects in their Ca.sup.2+ handling which gives rise to higher
cytoplasmic and sequestered Ca.sup.2+ levels.  This results in increased probability of recruitment of the platelet into the growing thrombus or diseased area.  This Ca.sup.2+ handling defect can be corrected according to the present invention by
medication with Ca.sup.2+ entry blockers; clinical improvement in the patient results.  Currently-available methods are not capable of assessing these abnormalities because such testing methods are too insensitive to the Ca.sup.2+ handling defect.  As
disclosed herein, the action of the Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers is readily demonstrated using a fluorescent probe technique for the measurement of platelet-sequestered Ca.sup.2+.
<BR><BR>Discovery of Ca.sup.2+ Entry Blockers; Cardiac and Smooth Muscle Effects: A large number of compounds, termed generically "Ca.sup.2+ -channel blockers" has seen widespread use in the control of angina and treatment of myocardial infarction. 
These are presently divided into three groups: (1) nifedipine and related 1,4-dihydropyridines, (2) verapamil and methoxyverapamil (D600), and (3) diltiazem and cinnarizine and related diphenylmethyl alkylamines.  A cardiac-inhibitory function of
verapamil was discovered by Fleckenstein (Fleckenstein, A., Tritthart, H., Fleckenstein, B., Herbst, A. and Grun, G., A new group of competitive Ca antagonists (Iproveratril, D600, Prenylamine) with high potent inhibitory effects on
excitation-contraction coupling in mammalian myocardium (1969), Pfluegers Arch.  306:R25) who showed that this compound had inhibitory actions similar to the removal of extracellular Ca.sup.2+.  Subsequently, he demonstrated that this action was shared
with methoxyverapamil and nifedipine.  He suggested that the compounds be termed "Ca.sup.2+ antagonists" and showed that the effects of these agents were to block the slow inward Ca.sup.2+ current during systole.  Subsequently, the compounds were shown
to inhibit Ca.sup.2+ influx into smooth muscle.  These properties make the compounds very suitable for control of angina and treatment of myocardial infarction.  The Ca.sup.2+ -channel blockers apparently exert their actions primarily at membrane
potential-dependent Ca.sup.2+ channels.  In smooth muscle, which can be stimulated both by membrane depolarization and noradrenaline or acetylcholine, the Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers are generally less effective against receptor-activated channels,
sometimes requiring four orders of magnitude higher doses for 50% effectiveness.  The literature shows that a given Ca.sup.2+ channel blocker will show different ED.sub.50 s for different tissues and that a given tissue will have different ED.sub.50 s
for different channel blockers.
<BR><BR>The present invention deals with the use of calcium channel blockers in diseases arising from platelet hyperactivation.  Contemporary knowledge in the art has failed to establish a definite effect of the calcium channel blockers on the platelet
and has a number of explanations each attributable to the conditions of the study and intricacies of the tested system.  The test of Ca.sup.2+ -handling abnormalities used in the present application is more specific to the diseased state and to the
mechanism of progression of peripheral obstructive disease.
<BR><BR>We have discovered and hereby disclose method of treating peripheral obstructive diseases in patients requiring such treatment in which a Ca.sup.2+ channel blocker is administered to the patient for a period of time and in therapeutic quantities
effective to relieve the disease symptoms and mitigate or remove the obstruction.
<BR><BR>Also disclosed is a sensitive diagnostic procedure for assessing defection, abnormal Ca.sup.2+ handling of platelets which is indicative of certain peripheral obstructive diseases and, in turn, a means to assess a patient's response to Ca.sup.2+
channel blockers in the therapy of such diseases.  Method for correcting the Ca.sup.2+ handling characteristics of blood platelets are also described. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a diagram (after Fuster, V. and Cheseboro, J. H. (1981), Current Concepts of Thrombogenesis: Role of Platelets, Mayo Clin. Proc.  56:102-112) showing the mechanisms by which platelets are activated.  The primary activating factors shown
on the left give rise to calcium influx into the cytoplasm and calcium release to the cytoplasmic from internal stores.  This is the primary intracellular trigger for aggregation.  The directions of action are given by the arrows.  The dotted lines
indicate positive feedback interactions.  For example, increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration brings about ADP release which, in turn, brings about increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing how the fluorescent probe chlorotetracycline (CTC) indicates accumulation in the dense tubules.  The probe is capable of making calcium complexes both in the aqueous base, in the cytoplasm and in the lumenar
(aqueous spaces) of the dense tubules and mitochondria.  These complexes make a small contribution to the total sample fluorescence.  These calcium complexes combine to the corresponding membrane surfaces.  The fluorescence contribution of the membrane
bound Ca.sup.2+ -CTC species is much higher than that of the corresponding aqueous species.  The relative size and contribution of the fluorescent signal from each species is indicated by the relative size of the symbols.  Uncomplexed CTC can cross the
membranes; Ca.sup.2+ -CTC cannot; thus the CTC accumulates in regions of high Ca.sup.2+ concentration and its fluorescence is a measure of the free Ca.sup.2+ concentration there.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 shows four fluorometer records illustrating the use of the CTC fluorescent technique and the calculation of CTC ratio.  Increasing fluorescence is plotted in the vertical direction and time is given in the horizontal direction.  Curve A is
for platelets from a patient with venous thrombosis; Curve B is for platelets from a healthy volunteer; Curve C is for metabolically-inhibited platelets from the same healthy volunteer; Curve D is a control experiment in which no platelets are added. 
The experiment was done at 37.degree.  C. with a Perkin Elmer (model MPF-3L) Fluorometer equipped with a top-mounted motor-driven plastic stirring rod and plastic cuvette.  Excitation and emission wavelengths were 380 nm and 520 nm, respectively.  The
medium was calcium and magnesium-free Tyrode solution containing 138 mM CaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 12 mM NaHCO.sub.3, 0.4 mM NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 with the pH adjusted to 7.35.  Abbreviations and final concentrations are: P=platelet suspension;
S=saline; 10 uM CTC; 2 mM Ca.sup.2+.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 shows the distribution of the CTC ratios observed in 18 patients with venous thrombosis.  This figure shows the decrease in the CTC ratio with nifedipine therapy and shows the lack of effect of standard therapy (heparin or dicoumarol)
alone.
<BR><BR>FIG. 5 shows the distribution of CTC ratios observed in 13 patients with arterial thrombosis and shows that the ratios are decreased by nifedipine therapy.
<BR><BR>FIG. 6 shows the distribution of CTC ratios observed in 17 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and 8 patients with vasculitis.  The figures shows that the CTC ratios are decreased by nifedipine therapy.
<BR><BR>FIG. 7 shows the distribution of the CTC ratios observed in 16 patients with myelofibrosis and shows that the CTC ratios are decreased by nifedipine therapy.
<BR><BR>FIG. 8 shows that the nifedipine therapy-normalized CTC ratios are observed to increase towards abnormal values after discontinuation of nifedipine therapy. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Mechanism by which Nifedipine and Other Ca.sup.2+ Channel Blockers Correct Diseases Involving Platelet Hyperactivation: While not wishing to be bound to any theory or mode of operation, our work demonstrates the efficacy of nifedipine in reducing
the internal Ca.sup.2+ levels in circulating platelets in patients with thyromboembolic disease which, in turn, returns the platelet aggregation characteristics to normal.  The rationale is based on the following unique observations: (a) the level of
Ca.sup.2+ stored in the organelles of the platelet can be readily determined by a simple technique using the fluorescence of the probe chlorotetracycline (CTC) which is coaccumulated with the sequestered Ca.sup.2+ (Haynes, D. H., Jy, W., Ahn, Y. S. and
Harrington, W. F. (1983), The use of Nifedipine in the treatment of thrombosis, U.M.  PHARM-Rept.  83/1 #PB 84 129055, National Technical and Information Service and Jy, W. and Haynes, D. H. (1984), Intracellular Ca.sup.2+ storage and release in the
human platelets: chlorotetracycline as a continuous monitor (submitted for publication)), (b) that the level of sequestered Ca.sup.2+ observed under nonstimulated or sub-threshold stimulated conditions increased with increasing Ca.sup.2+ permeability of
the plasma membrane, (c) that the resting level of sequestered Ca.sup.2+ is elevated in patients suffering from thrombosis or related platelet disorders (d) that the process of physiological activation of the platelet depends on the release of internally
sequestered Ca.sup.2+ to the cytoplasm (Fuster & Cheseboro, 1981; Haynes et al, 1983; Jy and Haynes, 1984) as well as Ca.sup.2+ influx across the plasma membrane, (e) that increased levels of sequestered Ca.sup.2+ render the platelet more sensitive to
stimulation by physiological agents, (f) that treatment of the patients with Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers decreases both the levels of sequestered Ca.sup.2+ and the rate of Ca.sup.2+ influx both under subcritical and critical levels of stimulation, (g)
that the circulating platelets are probably subjected to a large range of subcritical activating stimuli in the circulation of the thrombosis patient and that this opens a fraction of the Ca.sup.2+ channels, increases the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+
concentration, increases the levels of stored Ca.sup.2+ and generally predisposes the platelet to activation in the region of the growing thrombus where the strength of the stimuli is near critical or supercritical, (h) that treatment of the patient with
calcium channel blockers antagonize the effects of chronic subcritical stimulation (the most important effect shown in the applicants' work) and increases the threshold for recruitment of platelets into the growing thrombi, (i) that this protective
effect is not measured sensitively by the currently available aggregation tests, such as ADP- or collagen-stimulated aggregation, and (j) that the effects described above give rise to an increased rate of clinical improvement.
<BR><BR>The effectiveness of the Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers in reducing the rate of platelet depositions onto thrombi derives from the central role which Ca.sup.2+ plays in the activation process.  The novelty of the present invention is demonstrated by
the fact we have demonstrated that medication with the calcium channel blockers reduce.  the levels of stored and cytoplasmic calcium.  It was not possible to observe direct effects on the deranged platelets using standard methods since these rely on
massive stimulation during the course of the measurement, and thus obscure the difference between abnormal and normal platelets.  On the other hand, the CTC test described below and our studies with the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ indicator Quin 2 showed a
direct and dramatic effect which has extremely good predictive value with regard to the course of the patient's symptoms.  Reference to FIG. 1 shows that the levels of stored and cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ are primary determinants of the process of
aggregation.  This figure summarizes the mechanisms discussed by Fuster and Cheseboro (1981) in their review article on the mechanism of thrombosis formation and platelet aggregation.  The figure shows that all of the physiological stimulants, i.e., ADP,
thrombin, collagen and epinephrine, cause activation by increasing Ca.sup.2+ influx and by releasing internally stored Ca.sup.2+.  The ratio between Ca.sup.2+ influx and release of the stores may differ with the different activators.  However, Ca.sup.2+
influx does bring about increased cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ concentrations which can cause release of internally stored Ca.sup.2+.  Elevated cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ also brings about ADP release and prothrombin activation which further stimulate Ca.sup.2+
influx into the platelet and neighboring platelets, thereby increasing the degree of aggregation and recruiting new platelets into the clot.  The autocatalytic nature of this process would be expected to give rise to a sharp dependence on cytoplasmic
Ca.sup.2+ concentration.
<BR><BR>The platelet also contains a prostaglandin system which seems to serve as a mechanism for strengthening the response to stimulation.  The Ca.sup.2+ -induced phospholipase liberates arachidonic acid which is converted to thromboxane A.sub.2 which
is believed to increase the cyclic AMP level of adenylate cyclase activity resulting in the decreased rate of Ca.sup.2+ extrusion.  This would make it more difficult for the platelet to lower the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ level and would thus decrease the
probability that a stimulated platelet could recover normal Ca.sup.2+ homeostasis.

thrombosis, collagen-vasculitis, vasculitis lupus, and platelet disorders.
<BR><BR>Other conditions believed to be responsive to the treatment of the present invention include auto immune disorders involving platelets, other peripheral vascular diseases involving platelets, and atherosclerosis.  Understanding the fundamental
methodology one skilled in this art will recognize other conditions and disease states susceptible to treatment with Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers.
<BR><BR>Comparison with Conventional "Antiplatelet" Therapy Consisting of Dipyridamole or Aspirin: Consideration of FIG. 1 shows why treatment with these antiplatelet drugs is not completely successful and why the standard in vitro tests used to measure
calcium channel blocker efficacy as an antiplatelet drug have been unsuccessful.  The current antiplatelet drugs work only by protecting against the cyclic AMP effects "which give rise to a decreased rate of Ca.sup.2+ extrusion" (Fuster and Cheseboro,
1983).  Aspirin works by inhibiting the conversion of the archidonic acid to thromboxane A.sub.2 step.  Dipyridamole works by increasing the cyclic AMP level.  Both of these agents give rise to an increased rate of Ca.sup.2+ extrusions when compared to
untreated platelets.  However, these agents do not decrease the rate of Ca.sup.2+ influx.  The Ca.sup.2+ extrusion system is easily overwhelmed in the course of normal activation and it is probably just as easily overwhelmed in the abnormal platelet by
weaker stimuli.
<BR><BR>The applicants' work shows that the Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers are able to diminish Ca.sup.2+ influx into the diseased platelets.  This property has not been directly assessed by other workers because Ca.sup.2+ influx studies are more difficult
to do.  Also, standard activation studies are considered by most workers to be superior since they encompass the overall reaction.  But, as mentioned above, the autocatalytic nature of the activation process tends to make all activation processes
approach the same maximal level regardless of strength of the initial stimulus and despite the possible blocking of a large fraction of the channels.  Almost complete blocking of all of the channels would be necessary to suppress effects of a
super-threshold stimulus.  Significant effects of the channel blockers on diseased platelets might have been seen if the level of stimulus threshold had been specifically tested, but this type of detailed study is not common practice and is beyond the
present state of the art.  The novelty of the findings reported herein lies in both detection of the abnormality in the demonstration of its correction.  The ability of channel blockers to decrease the Ca.sup.2+ influx and thus reduce the levels of
releasable Ca.sup.2+ is readily seen by the chlorotetracycline (CTC) method.  The return of the nifedipine-treated platelets to normal Ca.sup.2+ homeostasis is shown to result in an increase in the rate of reversal of the disease.
<BR><BR>EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
<BR><BR>The Chlorotetracycline Method of Assessing Plasma Membrane Leakiness: The Ca.sup.2+ sensitive fluorescent probe chlorotetracycline (CTC) has been applied widely in biological systems to monitor active Ca.sup.2+ transport.  A large increase in
fluorescence accompanies active Ca.sup.2+ transport.  (Caswell, A. H. and Hutchison, J. P. (1971), Visualization of Membrane-bound cations by a fluorescent technique, Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.  Commun.  42:43-49; Caswell, A. H. (1972), The migration of
divalent cations in mitochondria visualized by a fluorescent chelate probe, J. Memb.  Biol.  7:345-364; Caswell, A. H. and Warren, S. (1972), Observation of calcium uptake by isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum employing a fluorescent chelate probe, Biochem. Biophys.  Res.  Commun.  46:1757-1763; and Gershergorn, M. C., and Thaw, C. (1982), TRH mobilizes membrane calcium in thyrotropic cells as monitored by chlorotetracycline, Am.  J. Physiol.  243:E298-E304).  Our previous work with isolated sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR) has shown that CTC fluorescence can be used to report the free internal Ca.sup.2+ concentration obtained by the Ca.sup.2+ -Mg.sup.2+ -ATPase pump (Millman, M. S., Caswell, H. H. and Haynes, D. J. (1980), Kinetics of chlorotetracycline
permeation in fragmented ATP-ase-rich sarcoplasmic reticulum, Membrane Biochemistry 3:291-315).  We have modeled the phenomenon showing that CTC accumulated in the organelle to an extent proportional to the free internal Ca.sup.2+ concentration.  The
(Ca-CTC).sup.+ complex binds to the internal surface of the organelle membrane.  Thus the fluorescence increase is proportional to the free internal Ca.sup.2+ concentration ([Ca.sup.2+ ].sub.i) in the SR lumen.
<BR><BR>Our studies of the human platelet have shown that the Ca.sup.2+ -sensitive fluorescent probe CTC can be easily used to monitor the Ca.sup.2+ movement in human platelets.  As shown in FIG. 2, (Ca-CTC).sup.+ complex accumulates in the dense tubules
and mitochondria.  The fluorescence signal has been shown to be a linear measure of the level of free Ca.sup.2+ in the dense tubules and in the mitochondria with probe sensitivity to Ca.sup.2+ concentrations in these organelles in the millimolar range. 
Experiments using low concentrations of the Ca.sup.2+ -ionophore A23187 showed that the level of free internal Ca.sup.2+ in the organelle depends upon the cytoplasmic level which in turn depends upon the passive permeability of the plasma membrane.  CTC
in the cytoplasmic compartment does not report to changes in the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ concentration ([Ca.sup.2+ ]cyt), which is held in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range by an extrusion system located in the plasma membrane.  Thus plasma membrane
leakiness or low levels of activation of the Ca.sup.2+ channels of the plasma membrane will increase the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ level, increasing the dense tubular and mitochondrial sequestered Ca.sup.2+ level and increasing the CTC signal.
<BR><BR>Quality Control and Reproducibility: The quality of the normal platelet samples from healthy volunteers was routinely determined before experimentation.  No spontaneous aggregation was found upon stirring.  All normal samples had to show normal
aggregation kinetics.  The ED.sub.50 for collagen and ADP-induced aggregation of normal platelets was 15--15 ug/ml and 1-3 uM, respectively.  This compares with literature values of 30 ug/ml (Chesney, C. M., Harper, E. and Colman, R. W. (1972), Critical
role of the carbohydrate side chains and collagen in platelet aggregation, J. Clin. Invest.  51:2693-2701) and 3 uM (MacMillan, D. C. (1966), Secondary clumping effect in human citrated platelet rich plasma produced by adenosine diphosphate and
adrenaline, Nature (London), 211:140-144), respectively.  The CTC assay itself was also used as a criterion of quality.  The responses shown in FIG. 3 were observed to be more sensitive measures of platelet quality than the above-cited tests.  After
approximately 24 hours of storage, the slow amplitudes shown in FIG. 3 increase while the size of the response to A23187 decreases.  As will be shown below, platelets isolated from patients suffering from thrombosis gave a CTC response typical of aged or
A23187-treated platelets from normal samples.
<BR><BR>Washed Platelet Suspension: Blood was drawn from patients and normal volunteers into ACD (acid-citrate-dextrose).  The red cells were removed by centrifugation at 150 g for 15 minutes.  Platelet concentrate was prepared by centrifugation at 900 g
for 20 minutes.  The platelets were washed twice and suspended in calcium and magnesium-free Tyrode solution containing 138 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 12 mM NaHCO.sub.3, 0.4 mM NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 with the pH adjusted to 7.35 with HCl and checked
on an hourly basis according to the method of (Mustard, J. F., Perry, D. W., Ardlie, N. G. and Pakham, M. A. (1972), Preparation of suspension of washed platelets from humans, Br.  J. Haematol.  22:193-204.  This medium was used in all experimentation. 
The platelet concentrate was adjusted to give 20% transmittance for aggregation experiments and 50% transmittance for CTC fluorescence experiments.  The data corresponded to 0.1 g/ml protein concentration.  Storage was at room temperature and
experimentation was at 37.degree.  centrigrade.  All samples were studied within 4 hours of blood drawing.
<BR><BR>Fluorescence was measured in a Perkin Elmer (model MPF-3L) fluorometer equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder (T=37.degree.  C.).  Reactions were carried out in a 1 cm plastic cuvette; mixing and stirring were achieved by a top
mounted motor-driven plastic stirring rod.  The excitation beam was polarized horizontally by a single polarizer (Chen, 1966) to reduce the light scattering effects.  The fluorometer collects emitted light over a wide angle and control experiments showed
that inner filter effects were negligible.  In these experiments, the platelets were incubated with 10 .mu.M chlorotetracycline at room temperature for 30 minutes before introduction into the fluorometer.  The excitation and emission monochrometers were
set at 380 nm and 520 nm, respectively.
<BR><BR>Platelet aggregation was measured by the turbidimetric method (according to Born, G.V.R.  (1962), Aggregation of blood platelets by adphosine diphosphate and its reversal, Nature 194: 927-929).  The extent of platelet aggregation was determined
by monitoring transmittance changes in a Beckman spectrophotometer (Model DB-G) at 600 nm.  This instrument was similarly equipped with a plastic cuvette and motor-driven stirring rod.
<BR><BR>Abnormal Platelets Show Abnormal CTC Response, Indicating Plasma Membrane Leakiness to Ca.sup.2+ : FIG. 3 is a series of experiments showing that abnormal platelets have higher levels of Ca.sup.2+ in their dense tubules and mitochondria than do
normal platelets.  The curves show thet typical CTC fluorescence response to Ca.sup.2+ addition for abnormal (Curve A) and normal (Curve B) platelets.  Curve B illustrates a standard protocol, showing the results of serial addition of platelets, CTC and
Ca.sup.2+.  The platelet addition gives rise to only a small light scattering artifact.  Addition of CTC results in a rapid rise in fluorescence, followed by a slow increase with a t.sub.1/2 of 4-5 minutes.  The rapid change is due to the fluorescence of
CTC in the aqueous phase and CTC bound to the outer surface of the plasma membrane.  At the low external Ca.sup.2+ concentrations, the corresponding Ca.sup.2+ complexes make only a small contribution (cf.  FIG. 2).  The slow fluorescence increase has
been shown to arise primarily in the binding of CTC and its Ca.sup.2+ complexes to the inner surfaces of the organelles.  The control experiments (Curve D) in the absence of platelets show that only 20-25% of the rapid response is due to CTC in the
aqueous phase.  No slow phase was observed.
<BR><BR>Information about Ca.sup.2+ handling by the platelets is obtained by observing the response to the Ca.sup.2+ addition.  Curve B shows that the addition of Ca.sup.2+ to a final concentration of 2 mM gives rise to two phases of increase: (a) An
instantaneous phase corresponding to the binding of the (Ca-CTC).sup.+ complex on the outside surface, and (b) a slower plase (t.sub.1/2 -6-8 min) due to increases in internal Ca.sup.2+ which, in turn, give rise to increase (Ca-CTC).sup.+ binding to the
internal membranes.  The slow phase has been shown to be due to active uptake of Ca.sup.2+ from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria and dense tubules.  It is largely blocked by 1 hour pretreatment with NaN.sub.3, oligomycin and trifluoperazine (Curve C).
<BR><BR>Previous work has shown that the cytoplasmic level is coupled to the external level by pumps and leaks in the plasma membrane.  This, in turn, is coupled to the mitochondrial and dense tubular levels.  Thus, elevating the external Ca.sup.2+
concentration increases the rate of Ca.sup.2+ influx and increases the cytoplasmic level.  This allows for increased uptake by the organelles.
<BR><BR>We have found that patients suffering from thromboembolism (venous and arterial) and immune thrombocytopenia, vasculitis and myelofibrosis have elevated levels of Ca.sup.2+ in their dense tubules and mitochondria, indicating a leaky plasma
membrane.  Curve A shows a result obtained with a patient suffering from arterial/venous thrombosis.  The fast phases are not affected by the disease, but the slow phases are greatly increased in amplitude.  A similar result (not shown) is obtained when
a normal platelet sample was pretreated with 20 nM A23187, a Ca.sup.2+ ionophore which makes plasma membrane permeable to Ca.sup.2+ (Jy and Haynes, 1984).  Both the mechanism of the CTC response and the comparison show that the abnormal platelets have an
increased uptake of Ca.sup.2+ into the organelles.  Experiments using the cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ monitor Quin 2 show that the abnormal platelets have increased cytoplasmic Ca.sup.2+ levels.  Experiments, reported below, show that the plasma membrane
defect can be corrected by administration of Ca.sup.2+ channel blockers is vitro and in vivo.
<BR><BR>Platelets from Patients with Thrombosis Show Increased Ca.sup.2+ Uptake: The ratio of the slow change to the fast change observed upon Ca.sup.2+ addition (FIG. 3) was taken as a measure of the Ca.sup.2+ handling abnormality.  Table I shows that
the value of this parameter in the thrombosis patients is 2.3-2.5 times the level observed in healthy controls.  Parameter I is the ratio of the amplitudes of the slow phase to the fast phase.  This parameter controls for possible differences in platelet
composition.
<BR><BR>Experiments show a large elevation of organelle-associated Ca.sup.2+ in platelets from patients with arterial or venous thrombosis.  Table I shows that stimulation with collagen (Parameter II) produces a correspondingly larger decrease in
fluorescence, as compared to normal controls (1.3-2.4 fold).  This suggests that the dense tubules in these abnormal platelets are capable of releasing more Ca.sup.2+ to the cytoplasm, suggesting a greater sensitivity towards activating agents.  Table I
also demonstrates that the abnormal platelets show a greater transmittance when stimulated by collagen.  However, this increase (abnormal/normal equals 1.3-1.5) was only marginally siginificant due to the large variability of the abnormal patients.  No
differences in aggregation rate were observed.  This supports the above observation that standard tests are insensitive to hypercoagulability disorders and that the CTC technique is a much more sensitive measure of the same.

<BR><BR>Ca.sup.2+ Handling Abnormalities of Patient with Thrombosis Is Correctable by In Vitro Treatment with A Nifedipine Analog: Table II shows that the abnormal CTC response of a patient suffering from arterial and venous thrombosis (Patient A) was
correctable by treatment with a nifedipine analog in vitro.  The isolated platelets were preincubated with the calcium entry blocker Y108-068 (a nifedipine analog) at 50 uM concentration for 30 minutes and were then tested for the three CTC parameters. 
The table shows that both the CTC ratio and the collagen-stimulated Ca.sup.2+ release were returned to normal values by the Ca.sup.2+ channel blocker.
<BR><BR>Platelet aggregation studies on this sample showed normal extents of aggregation stimulated by ADP and collagen for this patient.  The effect of Y108-068 on the extent of aggregation was small.
<BR><BR>Clinical Improvement with Nifedipine Administration in A Thrombosis Patient: Patient A: Below, we describe the clinical course of Patient A who was treated with nifedipine.  Patient A was a 68-year old man with myelofibrosis and myeloid
metaplasia and was suffering from recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  He was presented to us with massive DVT involving his left thigh, the size of which was 4 times larger than the right with severe erythema, a large hemorrhagic bullae from ischemia. Venogram and CAT scan confirmed large thrombi in the left iliac and femoral vein.  No abnormal mass was identified on the CAT scan.  He also experienced pleuritic chest pain consistent with pulmonary emboli on the lung scan.  Heparin therapy
(10,000-20,000 unit/hr) did not improve the DVT.  A filter was inserted to prevent further pulmonary emboli.  While on heparin he developed another large DVT on the right thigh.  DIC screens were negative.  Coagulation studies showed prolonged PTT from
heparin.  Platelets were large and bizarre with a count of 100,000/cumm.
<BR><BR>Patient A was administered the calcium channel blocker Procardia.RTM.(nifedipine) 10 mg T.I.D.  As shown below, this resulted in dramatic improvement of both the Ca.sup.2+ handling parameters of his plaetlets and of his condition.  Table II shows
that within 10 hours of initiation of nifedipine therapy, the CTC ratio and collagen-stimulated release parameters were within the normal range.  Within 24 hours after nifedipine therapy, pain improved requiring less narcotics.  Improvement of erythema,
tenderness and swelling was obvious on the third day of therapy.  In fifth day patient condition was improved to be transferred to the referring physician.

<BR><BR>The correlation of the CTC response of the isolated platelets with clinical improvement supports the further use of the CTC test as a measure of normalization of the platelet Ca.sup.2+ homeostasis by this drug.  Below, we report the results of
treatment of a large number of patients suffering from peripheral obstructive diseases.  The results show improvement of the Ca.sup.2+ handling after nifedipine treatment and lack of such improvement when nifedipine is not administered.
<BR><BR>Medication with Nifedipine Normalizes Ca.sup.2+ Handling in Patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis: Following the initial studies with Patient A, 18 patients with deep vein thrombosis were studied.  These patients were receiving standard therapy
consisting of heparin or oral anticoagulants.  FIG. 4 shows that treatment with nifedipine plus standard therapy brings about improvement in the Ca.sup.2+ handling of the platelets while the standard therapy alone brings about no improvement.  A total of
18 patients were studied.  Their mean value of the CTC Ca.sup.2+ handling parameter was 0.79.+-.0.29.  Eight patients were medicated with nifedipine (10-20 mg T.I.D.) and the course of improvement of calcium handling was monitored.  The treatment brought
the calcium handling parameter to normal values for all of the patients except one.  The right-hand portion of the figure shows the course observed for four patients who did not receive nifedipine.  In this group, none of the CTC ratios returned to
normal within seven days.
<BR><BR>Medication with Nifedipine Normalizes Ca.sup.2+ Handling in Patients with Arterial Thrombosis: Thirteen patients suffering from arterial thrombosis, some receiving antiplatelet drug such as persantin or aspirin, were studied.  The mean value of
the CTC parameter was 0.88.+-.0.27.  FIG. 5 shows the response of the CTC parameter to medication with nifedipine (10-20 mg T.I.D.) for four patients.  Nifedipine reduced the CTC values, bringing them into the normal range within seven days for all
patients.  These results are shown in FIG. 6.  Clinical improvement was observed in all patients.
<BR><BR>Medication with Nifedipine Normalizes Ca.sup.2+ Handling in Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia and Vasculitis Lupus: The CTC test was applied to 17 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and eight patients with vasculitis associated with
systemic lupus erythemotosis and other collagen vascular disorders.  The mean values of their CTC ratios were 0.62.+-.0.22 and 0.71.+-.0.16, respectively.  Six patients in these categories were medicated with nifedipine (10 mg T.I.D.).  FIG. 7 shows that
nifedipine therapy returned the CTC ratio to normal in three of these patients.  Increased platelet counts were also observed in some of the patients of this group.
<BR><BR>Medication with Nifedipine Normalizes Ca.sup.2+ Handling in Patients with Myelofibrosis: The CTC test was applied to 16 patients with myelofibrosis.  The mean value of the CTC ratio was 0.69.+-.0.27.  Five patients were medicated with nifedipine
(10-20 mg T.I.D.).  This treatment normalized the CTC Ca.sup.2+ handling parameter in four of the five patients, measured at seven days (FIG. 7).  The treatment also increased platelet counts in two of the patients.
<BR><BR>FIG. 8 shows the results for six patients whose CTC values were normalized by nifedipine administration.  After the value had stabilized in the normal range, nifedipine therapy was discontinued.  The CTC parameter was observed to rise in all
patients.  This is further proof that the normalization of the Ca.sup.2+ handling by these abnormal platelets is due to nifedipine, and is not a consequence of the standard therapy.
