</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p> Anlogs of ningalin B lacking inherent cytotoxic activity may be employed
     to reverse multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotype and to resensitize
     transformed cells, including a human colon cancer cell line
     (HCT116/VM46), with respect to a variety of cytotoxic agents, e.g.,
     vinblastine and doxorubicin. In many instances, resensitization is
     achieved at lower doses than the prototypical agent <B><I>verapamil</I></B>. Total
     synthesis of ningalin B and its analogs was achieved using a concise,
     efficient approach based on a heterocyclic azadiene Diels-Alder strategy
     (1,2,4,5-tetrazine.fwdarw.1,2-diazine.fwdarw.pyrrole) ideally suited for
     construction of the densely functionalized pyrrole core found in the
     natural product is detailed.

<BR><BR> The invention relates to methods and reagents for reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) with respect to anticancer drugs.  More particularly, invention relates to analogs of ningalin B and to their use as MDR reversal agents.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> The recently identified ningalin class of marine natural products including ningalin B (1) possess a common 3,4-diaryl substituted pyrrole nucleus bearing a 2-carboxylate.  Ningalin B (1) is the second member of this newly described family of
marine natural products which were isolated by Fenical (1997) from an ascidian of the genus Didemnum collected in western Australia near Ningaloo Reef.  (Kang, H.; Fenical, W. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 3254) Consequently, 1 and the related ningalins are
the newest members of a family of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-derived o-catechol metabolites that include the tunichromes.  (Bruening, R. C.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1985, 107, 5289; Bruening, R. C.; et al. J. Nat.  Prod. 1986, 49, 193; Bayer,
E; et al. Angew.  Chem. Int.  Ed.  Engl.  1992, 31, 52; Oltz, E. M.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1988, 110, 6162; Ryan, D. E.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1992, 114, 9659; Taylor, S. W.; et al. Arch.  Biochem.  Biophys.  1995, 324, 228)
<BR><BR> The lamellarins are a related rapidly growing class of marine natural products which were first isolated from the prosobranch mollusc Lamellaria sp.  and important members of this class have been disclosed by Bowden, Faulkner, Fenical, Capon,
and Scheuer.  (Lamellarins A-D: Anderson, R. J.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1985, 107, 5492.  Lamellarins E-H: Lindquist, N.; et al. J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 4570.  Lamellarins I-N: Carroll, A. R.; et al. Aust.  J. Chem. 1993, 46, 489.  Lamellarins O, P:
Urban, S.; et al. Aust.  J. Chem. 1994, 47, 1919.  Lamellarins Q, R: Urban, S.; et al. Aust.  J. Chem. 1995, 48, 1491.  Lamellarins S: Urban, S.; et al. Aust.  J. Chem. 1996, 49, 711.  Lamellarins T-X: Reddy, R. M.; et al. Tetrahedron 1997, 53, 3457. 
Lamellarin Z: Davis, R. H.; et al. J. Nat.  Prod. 1999, 62, 419.  Lukianol A, B: Yoshida, W. Y.; et al. Helv.  Chim.  Acta 1992, 75, 1721.) Recent investigations of several lamellarins demonstrated their cytotoxic activity, revealed equally effective
cytotoxic activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines, and revealed MDR reversal even at noncytotoxic concentrations by inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux.  (Quesada, A. R.; et al. Br.  J. Cancer 1996, 74, 677.) Thus, they
constitute a new class of antitumor agents which reverse MDR more effectively than verapamil and resensitize resistant malignant cells to front line therapeutics.  A number of related structures have been defined that lack cytotoxic activity but which
effectively reverse MDR.  (Ningalin A, lamellarin O, lukianol A, and permethyl storniamide A: Boger, D. L.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1999, 121, 54.)
<BR><BR> What is needed is a new class of MDR reversal agents having potent activity for resensitizing resistant cancer cells with respect to effective anticancer agents.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY

unsymmetrical, electron-rich alkyne.  Ningalin B is a member of a class of marine natural products characterized by a highly functionalized tetra- or pentasubstituted pyrrole which is ideally suited to construction using this strategy.  While lacking
inherent cytotoxic activity, the ningalin B synthetic precursors 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15, but not ningalin B itself, are shown to potently reverse MDR, resensitizing a resistant human colon cancer cell line (HCT116/VM46) to vinblastine and doxorubicin. 
These agents, including 14 bearing a novel ring system, constitute the members of a new class of effective MDR reversal agents.

2).
<BR><BR> Total Synthesis of Ningalin B. The requisite diphenylacetylene 5 was prepared by a palladium(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling of the terminal acetylene 3 (Upasami, R. B.; et al. J. Med.  Chem. 1997, 40, 73.) and 4 (0.05 equiv Pd(0), 0.3 equiv CuI,
Et.sub.3N, 87%) in which slow addition of the acetylene was necessary to suppress competitive formation of the coupled diacetylene (FIG. 3).  Conversion to the methoxymethyl ether 6 was accomplished by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of aldehyde 5 (1.2 equiv
m-CPBA), formate hydrolysis (KOH), and subsequent protection of the phenol (3.0 equiv MOMCl, 4.0 equiv i-Pr.sub.2NEt, 67% overall).  The first of the two key conversions, the Diels-Alder reaction of the electron-rich acetylene 6 with the
electron-deficient 1,2,4,5-tetrazine 2, (Boger, D. L.; et al. J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 5377.  Boger, D. L.; et al. Org. Synth.  1991, 70, 79.) proceeded to give the desired 1,2-diazine 7 in excellent yield (mesitylene, 140.degree.  C., 92%).  The relative
facility of this inverse electron demand [4+2] cycloaddition may be attributed to the electron-donating properties of the dienophile aryl alkoxy groups.  Thus, the oxygenation pattern found in the diaryl acetylene 6 increases the nucleophilic character
and improves what is a typically poor reactivity of an alkyne towards 2.  (Sauer, J.; et al. Chem. Ber.  1965, 98, 1435) Subsequent reductive ring contraction (Zn, HOAc, 62%) of 7 afforded the core pyrrole structure found in the natural product. 
N-Alkylation with the phenethyl bromide 9 (Lan, A. J. Y.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1987, 109, 2738) (5.0 equiv, K.sub.2CO.sub.3, 94%) and subsequent MOM deprotection with concomitant lactonization (HCl-EtOAc, 95%) provided mono-lactone 11.  (FIG. 4)
Selective hydrolysis of the methyl ester (LiI, 80%) and decarboxylation (Cu.sub.2O, quinoline, 220.degree.  C., 5 min, 70%) afforded hexamethyl ningalin B (13).  Decarboxylation with alternative copper sources or those conducted at lower temperatures or
with longer reaction times resulted in lower yields (0-44%).  Exhaustive demethylation with BBr.sub.3 completed the total synthesis of ningalin B and provided material identical in all respects (.sup.1H NMR, .sup.13C NMR, IR, MS) with authentic material. (Kang, H.; Fenical, W. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 3254.)
<BR><BR> Initial attempts to promote decarboxylation under acidic conditions resulted in either no reaction (neat TFA, 60.degree.  C., 12 h) or Friedel-Crafts acylation (neat Eaton's acid, 25.degree.  C., 18 h) to provide 14 (FIG. 5).  Although not the
object of the present efforts, the fused tricyclic ring system consisting of a 7-membered ketone flanked by an aryl group and a pyrrole has been formed by Friedel-Crafts acylation in the synthesis of cephalotaxus alkaloids.  (Girard, Y.; et al. J. Org.
Chem. 1983, 48, 3220.  Weinstein, B.; et al. J. Org. Chem. 1976, 41, 875.) Based on the precedented ease of formation of the 7-membered ring and .sup.1H and HMBC NMR spectroscopy, formation of the alternative 5-membered ring was excluded.  Importantly,
14 proved to be the most potent MDR reversal agent identified in this series, causing hypersensitivity towards vinblastine in the HCT/VM46 MDR-cell line.
<BR><BR> Cytotoxic Activity and Reversal of Multidrug Resistance.  A number of compounds in the structurally related lamellarin class of natural products possess cytotoxic activity.  (Quesada, A. R.; et al. Br.  J. Cancer 1996, 74, 677.) With exception
of ningalin A, (Ningalin A, lamellarin O, lukianol A, and permethyl storniamide A: Boger, D. L.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1999, 121, 54.) the biological evaluation of the ningalin family has not been explored.  Consequently, ningalin B and a number of
structurally related synthetic intermediates were tested in a L1210 cytotoxic assay, and the results are summarized in FIGS. 6 and 10.  Ningalin B was found to be only moderately active against both the L1210 and HCT116 cell lines, and a number of
synthetic intermediates displayed a similar level of activity due to their comparable structures.  Notably, the O-methyl derivative of ningalin B is 5-fold less active against L1210 and 2.5-fold less active against HCT116 than ningalin B, in agreement
with previous studies where an increase in the extent of O-methylation results in a decrease in cytotoxic activity.  (Ningalin A, lamellarin O, lukianol A, and permethyl storniamide A: Boger, D. L.; et al. J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  1999, 121, 54.)
<BR><BR> More importantly, a select set of the naturally occurring lamellarins have been shown to exhibit equally potent cytotoxic activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein and to reverse MDR at
noncytotoxic concentrations, resensitizing the resistant cell lines to conventional therapeutic agents.  (Quesada, A. R.; et al. Br.  J. Cancer 1996, 74, 677.) P-gp is a 170 kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein encoded in humans by the MDR1 gene which
exports drugs out of mammalian cells, lowering their intracellular concentration.  (Patel, N. H.; et al. Invest.  New Drugs 1994, 12, 1.  Gottesman, M. M.; et al. Annu.  Rev.  Biochem.  1993, 62, 385.) Therefore, 7-14 were also tested against a wild-type
human colon cancer cell line (HCT116) and two resistant HCT116 cell lines.  The first resistant cell line (HCT116/VM46) embodies the MDR phenotype and overexpresses P-glycoprotein while the second cell line (HCT116/VP35) derives its resistance through
underexpression of topoisomerase II.  The examination of the latter cell line along with the wild-type HCT116 and their comparison with HCT116VM46 allows an accurate assessment of the MDR sensitivity as well as an assessment of one potential therapeutic
target.  All of the agents examined showed little or no intrinsic cytotoxic activity against either HCT116 or the resistant cell lines.
<BR><BR> Fundamentally more important, many of the agents were found capable of reversing MDR at noncytotoxic concentrations, resensitizing HCT116/VM46 to vinblastine and doxorubicin (FIGS. 7 and 11).  As illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 11, solutions of
physiological buffer suitable for injection or infusion were prepared and admixed with ningalin B and its analogs for testing as MDR reversal agents.  Of the compounds examined, 10, 11, 13, and 14 were able to resensitize HCT116/VM46 to vinblastine and
doxorubicin at 1 .mu.M and to do so more effectively than verapamil.  While lacking inherent cytotoxicity, 11 and 13 showed complete MDR reversal at this concentration and 14 caused hypersensitivity of HCT116/VM46 to vinblastine, exhibiting an IC.sub.50
value 3.times.  lower than wild type treatment with vinblastine alone.  At the higher concentrations required for complete reversal by verapamil (7.5 .mu.M), 10 showed complete MDR reversal and the HCT116/VM46 cell line became hypersensitive to
vinblastine in the presence of 11 and 13.  The HCT116/VP35 resistant cell line showed no resensitization towards vinblastine or doxorubicin in the presence of the examined agents, indicating that the MDR reversal activity is due to interaction with P-gp.
Consistent with its action on Pgp-170, 14 inhibited dye efflux (Quesada, A. R.; et al. Br.  J. Cancer 1996, 74, 677.) (rhodamine 123) from HT116/VM46, returning the dye retention to levels equivalent to that of wild type HCT116 (FIG. 8).
