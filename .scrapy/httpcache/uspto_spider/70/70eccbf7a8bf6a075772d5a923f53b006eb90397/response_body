<BR><BR>(1) Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to euthanasia compositions which are used for producing humane death in lower mammals.  In particular the present invention relates to euthanasia solutions which contain the anesthetic gamma-hydroxybutramide
(embutramide), a chloroquine or quinacrine compound and lidocaine or a salt thereof.
<BR><BR>(2) Prior Art
<BR><BR>Euthanasia compositions for lower mammals are necessary in order to provide humane death.  Generally the solutions are injected intravenously or intraperitoneally.  Users or user facilities of such solutions are animal control facilities, humane
societies, veterinarians, veterinary hospitals, zoos and researchers.  The owners of such animals are all concerned with providing humane death.
<BR><BR>Euthanasia compositions containing barbiturates are on the market.  These solutions are controlled by the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) because of the barbiturates which are Class II or Class III controlled substances.  There is a
need for compositions which are not controlled because of the record keeping involved in handling the barbiturate compositions.
<BR><BR>The need to formulate a new euthanasia composition was prompted by problems with a euthanasia composition which was marketed under the name "T-61" and is no longer produced.  It is comprised of an anesthetic, gamma-hydroxybutramide; a local
anesthetic, tetracaine; a muscle relaxant, mebezonium; and a solvent, dimethylformamide.  The composition of this solution contains as solids, 78% gamma-hydroxybutramide; 2% tetracaine (a local anesthetic); and 20% mebezonium, and as liquids a mixture of
60% dimethylformamide and 40% water.  The solution contained 25.5% total solids and the solution has a non-viscous consistency and is injectable with a 22 gauge needle or larger.
<BR><BR>A component of T-61 was causing adverse side effects when the product was rapidly injected intravenously.  The physiological and pharmacological effects of each component of the euthanasia solution, T-61 were investigated.  The anesthetic,
gamma-hydroxybutramide, appeared to be an effective lethal drug at the recommended dose for T-61 (62 mg/kg).  Its onset of action occurred within 15 to 25 seconds and has a smooth, calm induction with 47% ethanol used as an investigational vehicle. 
Mebezonium, the neuromuscular blocking agent included in T-61 was found to be effective at the concentration contained in T-61.  The equi-effective dose of mebezonium is about 3 mg/kg and at the volume recommended for euthanasia with T-61, the dose of
the muscle relaxant is 15 mg/kg IV.  The onset of effect at the equi-effective dose is approximately 75 seconds.
<BR><BR>Tetracaine hydrochloride (5 mg/ml; 1.5 mg/kg) appeared to be responsible for bizarre behavioral effects when T-61 was given rapidly.  This dose is higher than those used for therapeutic purposes.  This response, e.g., stiffening of the forelimbs,
opisthotonos, and an apparent uneasy appearance was reproduced when tetracaine was given alone at the dose contained in T-61.  This undesirable effect is most likely due to the direct stimulatory effects of tetracaine on the central nervous system.  T-61
was recommended to be given slowly for this reason.  In practice it was given rapidly and produced the undesired behavioral response.  The euthanasia solutions approved by the FDA now for marketing do not allow a slow rate of injection since this is
impractical in use.
<BR><BR>Dimethylformamide (DMF) is the solvent used in T-61 to keep embutramide in solution.  DMF is used at a 60% by volume in water concentration in T-61 and appears to have a local irritating effect at the site of injection.  It also appears to have a
central stimulating effect which is observed within the first 15 seconds following injection.  This is then followed by a period of sedation lasting 15 to 30 minutes in some animals when given alone.  It does not appear to alter the onset of anesthesia
induced by embutramide nor contribute to the lethal effects of the anesthetic.  DMF is most likely responsible for the discomfort induced when T-61 is given rapidly.
<BR><BR>An additional problem with the T-61 composition is the appearance of a noticeable heart beat which persists during the euthanasia procedure.  Although this activity of the heart is ineffective in perfusing body tissues, the heartbeat is
nevertheless visible in thin chested dogs or small animals and usually persists for many minutes.  This is not esthetically pleasing to the owner nor to people performing euthanasia.
<BR><BR>Thus there is a need for an improved euthanasia solution.  Gamma-hydroxybutramide is not included on the list of drugs controlled by the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency.  In addition, it has a rapid onset of action causing almost immediate
anesthesia and cessation of breathing.  The problem then was to provide an effective formulation which overcomes the problems of the prior art with T-61.
<BR><BR>The cardiac depressant and potential lethal effects of chloroquine and quinacrine are recognized.  These drugs are used to treat malaria in human beings, but so far as is known, there has been no attempt to provide useful euthanasia formulations
with these drugs.
<BR><BR>In injectable formulations, the effects of high plasma concentrations of potassium on the heart is known.  This can be seen in Mudge, G. H. and Weiner, I. M., Water, Salts and Ions.  In Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of

<BR><BR>In parent application Ser.  No. 631,090, filed Dec.  19, 1990 gamma-hydroxybutramide and chloroquine or quinacrine compositions are described which are very effective in dogs.  In cats the results were poor.  Thus, there is a need for improved
euthanasia compositions which are effective in cats, as well as other animals.
<BR><BR>OBJECTS
<BR><BR>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved euthanasia compositions, which rapidly eliminate the presence of a noticeable heart beat and the stiffening encountered with T-61, and which are effective in cats as well as
other animals.  It is further an object to reduce or eliminate agonal breathing during the procedure.  Another object of the present invention is to provide compositions which are relatively inexpensive and which do not contain DEA controlled substances. These and other objects will become increasingly apparent by reference to the following description.
<BR><BR>GENERAL DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to a method for providing euthanasia in a mammal which comprises: premedicating the mammal with a tranquilizer; and introducing into the mammal an aqueous solution comprising a cardiotoxic compound selected from the
group consisting of a quinacrine compound and a chloroquine compound and a water solubilized gamma-hydroxybutramide in an anesthetic amount wherein euthanasia occurs in the mammal.
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to a method for providing euthanasia in a mammal which comprises introducing into the mammal, an aqueous solution comprising an admixture of a cardiotoxic compound selected from the group consisting of a quinacrine
compound or chloroquine compound in a cardiotoxic amount, a lidocaine selected from the group consisting of a water solubilized lidocaine as a base and water soluble salts thereof and a water solubilized gamma-hydroxybutramide in an anesthetic amount,
wherein euthanasia occurs in the mammal.
<BR><BR>Further, the present invention particularly relates to a method for providing euthanasia in a mammal which comprises introducing into the mammal an effective amount of a mixture of gamma-hydroxybutramide dissolved in a water miscible liquid
solubilizing agent; a chloroquine compound, a lidocaine compound; and optionally a water soluble inorganic salt in an aqueous solution so that the mammal is euthanasized within five (5) minutes.
<BR><BR>The present invention also relates to a composition for providing euthanasia in a mammal which comprises in admixture in an injectable aqueous solution a cardiotoxic compound selected from the group consisting of a quinacrine compound and a
chloroquine compound; a lidocaine selected from the group consisting of lidocaine as a base and water soluble salts thereof and gamma-hydroxybutramide, wherein the solution contains a ratio of gamma-hydroxybutramide to chloroquine of between about 3 to 1
and 6 to 1 and a ratio of lidocaine to gamma-hydroxybutramide between about 0.01 and 0.015 to 1, preferably 0.012 and 0.014 to 1, and in an amount sufficient to produce euthanasia.  A preferred ratio of lidocaine to gamma-hydroxybutramide is 1:7 to 1:8.
<BR><BR>The present invention also relates to a composition for providing euthanasia in a mammal which comprises in admixture an aqueous solution, gamma-hydroxybutramide dissolved in a water immiscible liquid solubilizing agent; a water soluble
chloroquine compound, a lidocaine compound; and a water soluble inorganic salt, wherein the solution contains a ratio of gamma-hydroxybutramide to chloroquine of between about 3 to 1 and 6 to 1 and a ratio of inorganic salt to gamma-hydroxybutramide of
between about 0.01 to 0.02 and a ratio of lidocaine compound to gamma-hydroxybutramide of between about 0.01 and 0.015 to 1, preferably 0.012 and 0.014 to 1, and wherein the solution produces euthanasia.
<BR><BR>The preferred compositions include as solids alone between about 70 to 80 percent by weight of the gamma-hydroxybutramide, 20 to 25 percent by weight of the chloroquine compound, 0.5 to 2.0% of the lidocaine compound, and between 0.8 and 2.0% by
weight of the potassium salt.  The composition preferably contains as liquids a mixture of about 40% by weight water and 60% by weight solvent, preferably ethanol or denatured alcohol in an amount sufficient to dissolve the solids.  The solids are
preferably between about 20 to 30 percent by weight of the solution.  Within these ranges the lethal dosage of the composition as an aqueous solution injected into the animal is preferably between about 0.15 and 0.35 ml per kg of body weight.  In
general, if too little of the composition is given, the time to produce death is prolonged.  If too much of the composition is given, unwanted side effects may be observed, such as agonal breathing.
<BR><BR>The preferred pH of the solution is between about 4.5 and 7.2 and buffers can be used to provide a pH between 6 and 7.  Buffers can include alkali metal bicarbonates, acetates, phosphates, as well as MOPS, HEPES, TRIS, and the like.
<BR><BR>Preferably the potassium salt is potassium chloride.  This salt has a known cardiotoxic activity as discussed above.  Other salts are magnesium, manganese, cobalt and cadmium.  Inorganic soluble salts also function to keep the other ingredients
in solution.
<BR><BR>The gamma-hydroxybutramide is preferably dissolved in a lower alcohol containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms.  Most preferably ethanol, which appears to be the least irritating locally at the site of injection, is used.  Denatured alcohol can also be
used.  Other solutions can be used as a solvent.
<BR><BR>Lidocaine is 2-diethylamino-N-[2,6-dimethylphenyl] acetamide.  The hydrochloride salt can be used and is commonly available.  Lidocaine base can be solubilized in the solvent used for the gamma-hydroxybutramide.
<BR><BR>The water used for the formulation should be free of contamination.  The formulation is usually in injectable form.
<BR><BR>In certain cases it may be desirable to package the solution in a form for multiple injection.  The solution can be spray injected or injected vis a hypodermic needle.
<BR><BR>In the preferred method between about 35 and 75 mg of gamma-hydroxybutramide, 5 and 20 mg of cardiotoxic compound, 0.2 to 1.0 mg of the lidocaine salt and preferably between about 0.5 and 3 mg of the water soluble potassium salt per kg of body
weight of the mammal is used to produce death in the mammal.  The composition is formulated so that it can be used at a dosage between about 0.15 and 0.35 ml per kg of body weight of the mammal for ease of administration.
<BR><BR>It is necessary to solubilize the gamma-hydroxybutramide (and lidocaine base if used) into solution with ethanol or denatured alcohol and then combine it with the chloroquine compound previously dissolved in alcohol or water.  Lidocaine base can
be prepared in a 2% concentration (20 mg/ml) in alcohol (ethanol or denatured alcohol).  Lidocaine hydrochloride is water soluble.  The chloroquine compound is soluble in alcohol and the potassium salt is water soluble.
<BR><BR>The dose of each component can be altered so that death occurs in 2.5 to 4 minutes instead of 1 to 2 minutes to reduce the incidence of agonal breathing as shown hereinafter.
<BR><BR>It is accepted to use an analgesic combined with a tranquilizer in clinical animal patients prior to euthanasia.  The tranquilizer and the analgesic will prevent agonal breathing.  The preferred analgesic is butorphanol and the preferred
tranquilizer is acepromazine.  Other known analgesics, tranquilizers, and anesthetics can be used and are well known to those skilled in the art. <BR><BR>SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>Preparation of Test Solutions
<BR><BR>When embutramide and chloroquine stock solutions were mixed according to the "recipe" of Table 1, the final volume of both chloroquine and embutramide is greater than the amount of liquid added.  For example, when 10 ml of alcohol is added to
embutramide powder, the final volume after the dry chemical is dissolved in the alcohol is approximately 12.5 ml.  Chloroquine diphosphate has a final volume of approximately 11.4 ml after being dissolved in 10 ml of water.  Calculations are the actual
mg/kg dosages based on the final volume of each component after dissolving in the stock solution.
<BR><BR>In the initial studies used to determine the compositions of this formulation, exact uniformity of the mixtures was not as important as determining which compounds should be included.  More conventional practice is to Q.S.  to a larger volume
such as 13 ml for embutramide and 12 ml for chloroquine.

<BR><BR>EMBUTRAMIDE STOCK SOLUTIONS
<BR><BR>Several stock solutions of embutramide (stock solution "A") were prepared containing four different amount of embutramide ranging from 3500 to 6000 mg in each solution.  This allowed one to alter the dose of embutramide administered without
changing the volume injected into the animal.  For example, at the lower embutramide concentrations, the administrations of the following volumes of final mixture yielded dose concentrations of embutramide as follows:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ 0.25 ml/kg =  approximately  35 mg/kg body weight  0.30 ml/kg = 42 mg/kg  0.35 ml/kg = 49 mg/kg  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>Similarly, the highest stock solution of embutramide yielded dose concentrations of embutramide after administration of the final mixture as follows:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ 0.25 ml/kg =  approximately  51 mg/kg body weight  0.30 ml/kg = 61 mg/kg  0.35 ml/kg = 71 mg/kg  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>CHLOROQUINE DIPHOSPHATE STOCK SOLUTIONS
<BR><BR>In a similar manner, "low" and "high" chloroquine diphosphate stock solutions were prepared, yielding chloroquine diphosphate does concentrations following injection of the mixture as follows:

<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>These tests focused on euthanasia solutions for use in cats.  It was found that lidocaine HCl produced a smoother euthanasia in cats, without comprising the effects in dogs of the composition of Ser.  No. 631,090.  Previous studies also
demonstrated that embutramide was the component in the solution responsible for injection reactions in cats.  The more effective stock solution in dogs with lidocaine HCl added was 4 gm embutramide, 2 gm chloroquine, 100 mg KCl, and 100 mg of lidocaine
HCl or in a denatured alcohol solution.  However, this high dose of lidocaine HCl induced stimulatory effects in cats and it was thought that a lower dose was better, e.g., 75 mg at 0.25 ml/kg of the mixture.  For these tests cats were premedicated with
butorphanol (analgesic) and acepromazine (a tranquilizer) to avoid discomfort.
<BR><BR>In an attempt to alleviate the injection reaction problem in cats, the concentration of embutramide was decreased to 3.5 gm in the stock solution.  If the injection reaction was concentration dependent, then a lower concentration of embutramide
might solve the problem while still being high enough to achieve euthanasia with a single dose.
<BR><BR>Two solutions, using the lower concentration of embutramide, were selected for testing, one with lidocaine HCl and no NaHCO.sub.3, and one with NaHCO.sub.3 but no lidocaine HCl.  Buffering lidocaine HCl with NaHCO.sub.3 caused he solution to
precipitate.
<BR><BR>Three different IV techniques of IV injection were examined to further evaluate whether the observed undesirable responses were caused by the speed of injection and/or concentration of embutramide.  We found that the responses were caused by the
high embutramide concentrations.
<BR><BR>Dogs were included as well to assure that any modifications that were found to be effective in cats would also be efficacious in dogs.
<BR><BR>METHODS
<BR><BR>Testing in dogs and cats followed the same protocol as described earlier.  An IV catheter was placed in the cephalic vein of dogs and cats scheduled for euthanasia at the Ingham County Animal Control Facility, Mason, Mich.  One-half of the
animals were premedicated with butorphanol (B) (0.1 mg/kg) combined with acepromazine (A) (0.15 mg/kg) (B/A) IV 4 to 6 minutes prior to the injection of a test solution.  Two stock solutions were evaluated (Table 3): one composed of 3.5 embutramide,
chloroquine, potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (ECKB), the other composed of 3.5 embutramide, chloroquine, potassium chloride and lidocaine HCl (ECKL).

______________________________________
<BR><BR>These were administered in a randomized blinded format at a dose of 0.25 ml/kg for cats and 0.35 ml/kg for dogs.  The person evaluating the response did not know the components of the test solutions.  These doses were based on previous studies
for each species.  These two solutions were injected using 3 different techniques: 1) IV push--the entire volume of solution injected within 1 to 2 seconds, 2) IV slow--the volume of solution injected over 15 seconds, and 3) IV 1/2 dose bolus--one half
of the solution injected IV push with the remaining 1/2 of the dose administered IV push 30 seconds after the first 1/2 of the dose.
<BR><BR>DOGS
<BR><BR>Each solution was tested in 30 dogs; 15 were premedicated with B/A as described above and 15 were unpremedicated.  The group of fifteen dogs was further divided into 3 groups of five animals each in which the solutions were injected with three
different methods as indicated above.
<BR><BR>CATS
<BR><BR>This same format was followed in cats except that each solution was administered to 36 cats; 18 of which were premedicated with B/A and 18 not premedicated.  Each group of 18 cats was then divided into 3 groups of 6 cats each which was euthanized
using one of the 3 different injection techniques.
<BR><BR>Scoring criteria are listed in Table 4.  If an animal demonstrated agonal breathing, as defined in Table 4, the score of 1 to 5 was designated with the addition of an "A".  Animals needing more drug following the initial injection to complete the
euthanasia were designated with a "M".
<BR><BR> TABLE 4  ______________________________________ SCORING*  ______________________________________ 1. Smooth induction, no reaction to the injection, death  occurs within 3 minutes.  2. Smooth induction, no reaction to the injection, heart  beat
is visible more than 3 minutes but less than 5  minutes.  3. Animal shows a reaction to the injection; heart beat  visible for less than 3 minutes.  4. Animal shows a reaction to the injection; heart beat is  visible more than 3 minutes but less than 5
minutes.  5. Unsatisfactory euthanasia: bad reaction AND/OR animal  does not die and must be given another drug or  euthanasia after 5 minutes.  ______________________________________ *Scores will be designated with an "A" if agonal breathing occurred. 
Agonal breathing is defined as any breath taken immediately before or  after the heart beat is no longer visible.
<BR><BR>For cats that showed a reaction to injection, e.g., those that received a 3, 4, or 5, they were further evaluated as follows: 1 if they looked at the injection site, 2 if they pulled the leg or moved, or 3 if they vocalized.  These were
additionally graded with an a for a mild behavioral reaction; b for a moderate reaction; or c for a strong reaction.  If an animal vocalized in response to the injection, the score would be 3; the second letter score indicated the severity of the vocal
response: a for a soft moan; b for a cry; or c for a louder response.

<BR><BR>Agonal breathing occurred in 30 per cent of the dogs with acceptable scores and the time of death was between 2:27 and 3:39 minutes.  When dogs were premedicated with B/A and given this same solution, the scores were slightly higher, 2.6 vs 1.2
for IV push and 2.0 vs 1.6, respectively.  The IV slow in which the solution is injected over a 15 second period scored best with the dogs premedicated.  No agonal breathing was observed.  The time of death in the premedicated group was more than 3
minutes.  However, the IV push with no B/A still had the best score.
<BR><BR>If the 3.5 ECKB is compared with the ECKL in dogs not premedicated (Table 6), the best score was still 3.5 ECKB injected by IV push.  There was a 30 per cent incidence of 5 scores in the IV push and IV slow dogs with the lidocaine added compared
to no 5 scores in the ECKB groups respectively and the mean time of death was longer, e.g., about 4 minutes.

<BR><BR>If given slowly, 1 of the 6 cats reacted and the duration was more than 5 minutes in 66 per cent of the cats.  It is interesting to note that giving the 3.5 ECKL solution to premedicated cats by 1/2 bolus eliminated the reactions but 33 per cent
of the animals took longer than 5 minutes to die, which is unacceptable.  In comparing the premedicated cats euthanized with ECKB or ECKL, the best results was with ECKB using the IV push technique.
<BR><BR>DISCUSSION
<BR><BR>It is apparent that premedication with 0.1 mg/kg of butorphanol and 0.15 mg/kg of acepromazine eliminated the problem of agonal breathing in both dogs and cats.  It also dramatically decreased the incidence of injection reactions in cats.  It
appears that adding lidocaine HCl was most effective in dogs if they were premedicated.  However, the lower embutramide solution, e.g., 3.5 vs 4.0 gm in the stock solution without lidocaine was also effective in dogs.  To prevent agonal breathing,
premedication with butorphanol and acepromazine may be used and the solution can be given by IV push or slow IV over a 15 second period.
<BR><BR>In cats, the 3.5 ECKB solution was most effective in premedicated cats and the time of death was about 3 minutes if they were premedicated.  It is also important to note that the premedicated group given 3.5 ECKL had the highest percentage of
cats that needed more drug to complete euthanasia, yet the lowest incidence of injection reaction.  The fewest cats needing more drug was in the premedicated group for 3.5 ECKB which is the solution with the best score.
<BR><BR>In cats, the 3.5 ECKB solution at 0.25 ml/kg yields an approximate dose for each component as follows (Table 11): 44 mg/kg embutramide, 11 mg/kg chloroquine, and 0.6 mg/kg potassium.

<BR><BR>CONCLUSION
<BR><BR>The use of B/A premedication in both dogs and cats has the advantage of eliminating undesirable side effects (agonal breathing and injection reactions) and additionally, provides for a calmer more aesthetically pleasing euthanasia.  The preferred
dose of the compositions tested in this phase were 0.35 ml/kg for dogs and 0.25 ml/kg for cats.

<BR><BR>Euthanasia of the pony and horse went well and were dead within 2 to 3 minutes.  Both had minor agonal breaths, 1 and 2 small breaths, respectively, and we suspect that the dose in the horse will be either 0.20 or 0.25 ml/kg IV.
<BR><BR>These results show that lidocaine base is more effective in reducing side effects in cats in the preferred compositions.
<BR><BR>The results of the testing of the various ingredients in the formulations using procedures of Examples 1 and 3 were as follows:
<BR><BR>(1) Two high doses of embutramide (61.6 and 92.4 mg/kg) when used alone were lethal.  The three lower doses, 15.5, 23.1, and 31 mg/kg were found to be below the euthanasia threshold.  However, from the observations made, it appeared that 31 mg/kg
IV might not allow survival.  Therefore for safety purposes in survival studies, embutramide was administered at 15.5 and 23.1 mg/kg IV to determine the time of onset of anesthesia and other effects under laboratory conditions in healthy conditioned
dogs.  There were no significant differences (PL0.05)between the time of death at the two highest doses (61.6 and 92.4 mg/kg), achieving euthanasia in less than 3 minutes.
<BR><BR>(2) With the addition of the cardiotoxins, it was found that the formulation improved when lower amounts of embutramide were used.  The amount of embutramide in the final stock solution with embutramide was 3.5 grams and was effective for cats,
dogs, and horses.  The preferred dose for the animals was as follows: 45 mg/kg for dogs using 0.35 ml/kg of the mixture, 40 mg/kg at 0.30 ml/kg, and 34 mg/kg using 0.25 ml/kg.  The preferred effective dose of the euthanasia solution in dogs was 0.35
ml/kg, 0.25 to 0.30 ml/kg for cats, and estimated at 0.25 ml/kg for horses.
<BR><BR>(3) The use of butorphanol/acepromazine premedication in both dogs and cats had the advantage of eliminating undesirable side effects (agonal breathing and injection reactions) and additionally, provided for a calmer more aesthetically pleasing
euthanasia.  The dose tested with premedication was 0.35 ml/kg for dogs and 0.25 ml/kg for cats.
<BR><BR>(4) Lidocaine HCl did not solve the problem of injection reactions.  Therefore, lidocaine base was substituted for lidocaine HCl as the preferred local anesthetic to reduce injection reactions.  With lidocaine base, the most effective dose for
dogs was 3.5 ECKL at a dose of 0.35 ml/kg and for cats, the same mixture at a dose of 0.25 ml/kg without adverse side effects.  The effective dose for lidocaine is 0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg.
<BR><BR>(5) Although the inclusion of this small amount of potassium chloride may not contribute measurably to the effectiveness of the euthanasia solution, it does play a role in improving the formulation and maintaining the stability of the solution. 
The reason for this phenomenon was and is not clear.  The dose of potassium chloride in the formulation ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg.
<BR><BR>(6) Chloroquine diphosphate was found to be effective in stopping the heart in 3 minutes when combined with embutramide and potassium chloride.
<BR><BR>(7) It was evident that increasing the dose with alcohol solutions resulted in an increase in agonal breathing.  The alcohol solutions tested were ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and denatured alcohol.  The best overall results occurred at the 0.25
and 0.30 ml/kg dose with the ethanol solution and the 0.30 and 0.35 ml/kg with denatured alcohol.  These results suggest that denatured alcohol is an alternative solvent for ethanol.  Due to high scores and a large number of dogs exhibiting agonal
breathing, isopropyl alcohol was not considered for further testing.  The preferred solvent used in the formulation was denatured alcohol.
<BR><BR>(8) The preferred formulation was comprised of embutramide, chloroquine, lidocaine base, and potassium chloride mixed in denatured alcohol (about 56%) and distilled water (ECKL).  To mix the ECKL, 3.5 grams embutramide was added to 10 ml of stock
denatured alcohol.  The solution was then warmed to be mixed and yielded 13 ml containing 269 mg/ml.  Two grams chloroquine diphosphate was added to 10 ml of water and this solution was also warmed for mixing and yielded 11.2 ml containing 178 mg/ml. 
Potassium chloride (100 mg) was added to 6.25 ml H2O and combined with 75 mg lidocaine dissolved in 3.75 ml denatured alcohol.  The potassium chloride concentration was 10 mg/ml and that of lidocaine was 7.5 mg/ml.  The stock solutions were:
<BR><BR>A. 3.5 grams embutramide added to 10 ml of stock denatured alcohol solution warmed when mixed and yielded 13 ml containing 269 mg/ml.
<BR><BR>B. 2 grams chloroquine diphosphate added to 10 ml of water solution warmed when mixed and yielded 11.25 ml containing 178 mg/ml.
<BR><BR>C. 100 mg potassium chloride added to 6.25 ml water plus 75 mg lidocaine in 3.75 ml denatured alcohol.  The potassium chloride concentration was 10 mg/ml and lidocaine was 7.5 mg/ml.
<BR><BR>D. 75 mg lidocaine was dissolved in 3.75 ml of denatured alcohol plus 6.25 ml distilled water.  The lidocaine was 7.5 mg/ml.  The mixtures tested were:
<BR><BR>1.  A +.5 B +.5 C and
<BR><BR>2 A +.5 B +.5 D
<BR><BR>reflecting the use of either the lidocaine base or lidocaine hydrochloride.  The amounts are by volume.  Solution comprised of about 56% denatured alcohol.
<BR><BR>The doses of the compounds used in the formulations were as shown in Table 19.
