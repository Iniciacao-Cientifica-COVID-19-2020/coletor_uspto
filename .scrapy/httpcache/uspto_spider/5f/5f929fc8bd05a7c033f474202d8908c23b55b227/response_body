<BR><BR>The present invention is directed to aminoquinoline derivatives of the general formula ##STR2## wherein R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 are independently selected from hydrogen or alkyl, provided that no more than two substituents from R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 may
be simultaneously alkyl; R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 signify alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl, or together with the N atom signify pyrrolidine or piperidine, which optionally can be substituted by alkyl, or octahydroindole or 3-azabicyclo[3,2,2]nonane; and n=0 or 1; or
<BR><BR>wherein the symbols R.sup.1 and R.sup.3 signify tri- or tetramethylene; R.sup.2 and R.sup.4 to R.sup.6 signify hydrogen; n=0; and R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 are defined as above; or
<BR><BR>wherein the symbols R.sup.1 and R.sup.7 signify methylene or dimethylene and n=1, or
<BR><BR>R.sup.1 and R.sup.7 signify di- or trimethylene and n=0, or
<BR><BR>R.sup.3 and R.sup.7 signify di- or trimethylene and n=1, or
<BR><BR>R.sup.3 and R.sup.7 signify tri- or tetramethylene and n=0, or
<BR><BR>R.sup.5 and R.sup.7 signify tri- or tetramethylene and n=1, or
<BR><BR>R.sup.1 and R.sup.5 signfly di- or tri-methylene and n=1, and the
<BR><BR>remaining substituents signify hydrogen, except R.sup.8 which signifies alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl; or
<BR><BR>wherein the symbols R.sup.3 and R.sup.5 signify tri- or tetramethylene and n=1; all remaining substituents to R.sup.6 signify hydrogen; and R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 signify alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl or together with the N atom signify pyrrolidine or
piperidine, which optionally can be substituted by alkyl; R.sup.9 signifies hydrogen or halogen; and R.sup.10 signifies halogen or trifluoromethyl,
<BR><BR>and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and hydrolyzable esters thereof.
<BR><BR>These compounds are useful in the treatment and prevention of malaria.
<BR><BR>The compounds described above are novel with the exception of the following specific compounds, which are hereinafter referred to as the "Z-compounds":
<BR><BR>N.sub.2 -(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N.sub.1,N.sub.1 -dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine,
<BR><BR>N.sub.2 -(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N.sub.1,N.sub.1 -diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine,
<BR><BR>N.sub.3 -(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N.sub.1,N.sub.1 -dimethyl-propane-1,3-diamine,
<BR><BR>N.sub.3 -(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N.sub.1,N.sub.1 -diethyl-propane-1,3-diamine,
<BR><BR>(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-(2-piperidin-1-yl-ethyl)-amine,
<BR><BR>(7-chloro-quinnolin-4-yl)-[(1-ethyl-pyrrolidin-2-yl)-methyl]-amine,
<BR><BR>(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-(1-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-yl-methyl)-amine,
<BR><BR>(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-(1-methyl-piperidin-2-yl-methyl)-amine and
<BR><BR>(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-(1-methyl-piperidin-3-yl)-amine.
<BR><BR>All of the foregoing compounds including the Z-compounds, have the surprising and newly discovered property that they have an equally good effect not only against chloroquine-sensitive malaria pathogens, but also against chloroquine-resistant
malaria pathogens, that is to say, they exhibit no cross-resistance with chloroquine.
<BR><BR>Not only the absence of cross-resistance, but also the good activity, which is to some extent better compared with chloroquine, were surprising.  Hitherto it had been assumed that cross-resistance exists between chloroquine-like compounds.  Only
certain bis-quinolines, which contain two quinoline rings and which bear little structural relationship to chloroquine, have a definite activity against chloroquine-resistant malaria pathogens, especially the compounds which have been described by J. L.
Vennerstrom (J. L. Vennerstrom et al, J. Med.  Chem., 35, 2129-2134 (1992).  Further, it had hitherto been assumed that chloroquine analogues having shortened or lengthened side-chains were less active against malaria pathogens compared with chloroquine
(R. L. O'Brien and F. E. Hahn, Chloroquin Structural Requirements for Binding to Deoxyribonucleic Acid and Antimalarial Activity, Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother, 1965, 315-320).
<BR><BR>Simple analogues of chloroquine have therefore hitherto been considered to be uninteresting and not suitable for the treatment for malaria.  In contrast to this assumption, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I are outstandingly
suitable for the prophylaxis of malaria and for its treatment, especially in cases where the pathogens are resistant to chloroquine.
<BR><BR>The objects of the present invention are the use of compounds of formula I and the Z-compounds and of pharmaceutically usable salts and hydrolyzable esters thereof in the control or prevention of malaria, especially in the control of
chloroquine-resistant and of chloroquine-sensitive malaria pathogens; the novel compounds of formula I; the manufacture of the compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions
containing said compounds or salts or hydrolyzable esters thereof, and the manufacture of such pharmaceutical compositions.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The term "alkyl" used in the present description denotes straight-chain or branched saturated C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 hydrocarbon residues, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, t-butyl and the like.
<BR><BR>Halogen signifies chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine.
<BR><BR>Compounds in which R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 are hydrogen or in which one or two of R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 are independently selected from alkyl and the other substituents are hydrogen, and wherein R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 are independently selected from alkyl,

<BR><BR>The pharmaceutically acceptable salts includes any salt chemically permissible in the art for the compounds of formula I and applicable to human patients in a pharmaceutically acceptable preparation.  Any such conventional pharmaceutically
acceptable salt of the compounds of formula I can be utilized.  Among the conventional salts which can be utilized there are the base salt, for example, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium or
potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, and ammonium or alkyl ammonium salts.
<BR><BR>The novel compounds of formula I can be manufactured in accordance with the invention as follows:
<BR><BR>a) reacting quinoline derivatives of the general formula ##STR3## wherein R.sup.9 and R.sup.10 have the above significances and R signifies a leaving group, with amino compounds of the general formula ##STR4## wherein the substituents R.sup.1 to
R.sup.8 have the above significances, or
<BR><BR>b) reacting alkylamino-quinoline derivatives of the general formula ##STR5## wherein R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 and R.sup.9 and R.sup.10 have the above significances and R signifies a leaving group, with amines of the formula
<BR><BR> wherein R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 have the above significances, or
<BR><BR>c) reacting compounds of formula I in which R.sup.1 to R.sup.6 as well as R.sup.9 and R.sup.10 have the above significance and R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 signify hydrogen or one of them signifies hydrogen and the other signifies an alkyl group with
alkylating agents which are suitable for the alkylation of amino groups, and
<BR><BR>d) if desired, converting a basic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically usable salt by means of an acid.
<BR><BR>According to variant a) of the process in accordance with the invention correspondingly substituted quinoline derivatives which contain a leaving group in the 4-position are reacted with amino compounds of general formula III, the substituents
having the significances given above and R signifying a leaving group.
<BR><BR>Leaving groups are well recognized in the art and conveniently are halogen, O-methylsulphonyl or O-toluenesulphonyl groups.  The reaction is conveniently effected in a temperature range between 120.degree.  and 180.degree.  C. and in a solvent,
with phenol, ethoxyethanol, dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidine being especially preferred.  The reaction time can vary between 2 and 28 hours.
<BR><BR>A further possibility for the manufacture of the compounds of general formula I comprises using process variant b).
<BR><BR>Conveniently, the compounds of formula IV in which R signifies a leaving group and all other substituents are as defined above is reacted in the form of the hydrochloride of the correspondingly substituted alkylamino-quinoline derivative with an
aliphatic or cyclic amine of formula V in a sealed tube, whereby the amine can simultaneously serve as the solvent.  The reaction can take up to 24 h. The preferred temperature range embraces temperatures between 90.degree.  and 110.degree.  C. This
reaction can also be effected in solvents in which both reaction partners are soluble, for example in DMF, DMA, N-methylpyrrolidone or acetonitrile.  The conversion into a pharmaceutically usable salt is effected by adding an acid.  HCl is especially
preferred because of the physiological compatibility of the hydrochloride.  Convenient solvents which are especially suitable are: isopropanol, diethyl ether or dioxan.
<BR><BR>Alkylating agents which are suitable for process variant c) are, for example, formaldehyde in combination with formic acid, in which case the reaction is preferably carried out in excess formic acid.  Other useful alkylating agents include
combinations of aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes with complex hydrides such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride.  Such reactions can be conveniently carried out in alcoholic or aqueous solutions.
<BR><BR>The quinoline derivatives of general formula II required for synthesis variant a) are commercial products or can be prepared according to methods known per se, for example 7-chloro-4-hydroxyquinoline can be converted with phosphorus oxybromide
into 7-chloro-4-bromo-quinoline.
<BR><BR>The aliphatic or cyclic amines of general formula III are also available commercial products or can be prepared according to methods known per se.  Conveniently, the starting point can be a cyclic amine, for example pyrrolidine or piperidine, or
an aliphatic amine, e.g. dimethylamine or diethylamine, which can be reacted with nitroethane or 2-nitropropane.  The resulting nitro compound can subsequently be reduced according to methods known per se, e.g. by hydrogenation with Raney-nickel, to the
compounds of general formula III.
<BR><BR>A further possibility for the preparation of the compounds of general formula III comprises converting cycloalkane oxides with diethylamine and perchlorates into 2-(diethylamio)-cycloalkanols.  These are conveniently dissolved, without further
purification, in THF and treated with phthalimide and triphenylphosphine and subsequently stirred at room temperature for several hours.  After purification the resulting N,N-diethyl-2-phthalimido-cycloalkylamine is saponified with concentrated
hydrochloric acid.
<BR><BR>In analogy thereto, in place of diethylamine and other aliphatic amines there can also be used, for example, cyclic amines such as pyrrolidine.  When cyclic amines, for example piperidine, are reacted with acrylonitrile there is obtained the
corresponding propionitrile which can be hydrogenated to the corresponding propylamine in the presence of platinum dioxide at room temperature (RT) under pressure of 10 bar.
<BR><BR>The corresponding alkylamino-quinoline derivative of general formula W in which the leaving group signifies a halogen group, preferably chlorine, required as the starting material for synthesis variant b) can conveniently be prepared as follows:
<BR><BR>A suspension of the corresponding quinolinamino-ethanol, which can be prepared according to a synthesis of R. C. Elderfield, J. Am.  Chem. Soc.  68, 1250 (1946), is treated with thionyl chloride, whereby the reaction temperature should not exceed
30.degree.  C. Subsequently, the mixture is stirred at RT for 1 h., evaporated to dryness and purified.
<BR><BR>As mentioned earlier, the aminoquinoline derivatives of general formula I and their pharmaceutically usable salts have extremely valuable pharmacological properties.
<BR><BR>Their activity against not only chloroquine-resistant, but also chloroquine-sensitive malaria pathogens will be evident from the following Tables:
<BR><BR>Test method for the determination of the activity against P. falciparum in vitro
<BR><BR>The preparations of the present invention were tested on intraerythrocytary stages of P. falciparum from asynchronous cultures according to the method of Desjardin et al. (Desjardins, R. E. et al: Quantitative assessment of antimalarial activity
in vitro by a semiautomated microdilution technique.  Antimicrob.  Agents Chemother.  16, 710-718, (1979)).
<BR><BR>The culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640 with the addition of 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaHCO.sub.3, 100 mg/ml neomycin and 10% human serum (A.sup.+).  Human-A.sup.+ erythrocytes were used as the P. falciparum host cells.  The parasites were maintained
at 37.degree.  C. in an atmosphere of 3% O.sub.2, 4% CO.sub.2, 93% N.sub.2 and at 95% relative humidity.
<BR><BR>In order to determine the activity, the preparations were dissolved in DMSO, pre-diluted in the culture medium to a suitable starting concentration and subsequently titrated-out into microtitre plates in the 2nd stage over 6-7 steps.  After the
addition of the parasite culture (0.7% parasitemia in 2.5% erythrocyte suspension), the test plates were incubated under the conditions given above for 48 h-72 h. The parasite growth in the different preparation concentrations was determined using
[G-.sup.3 H]-hypoxanthin incorporation compared to untreated control cultures on the same test plates.  The 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was calculated according to logit regression analysis from the resulting dosage-activity curve.
<BR><BR>The preparations were tested on at least one chloroquine-resistant and one chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain.  Additional sensitive and resistant strains were also included for further characterization.
<BR><BR>Test method for the determination of the activity against Plasmodium berghei in vivo
<BR><BR>The preparations according to the present invention were tested on mice infected with malaria pathogens (Plasmodium berghei).  Male albino mice (IBM:MORO(SPF), FUELLINSDORF) weighing about 25 g were used as the test animals.  They were kept in
climatized rooms at 21.degree.-22.degree.  C. in groups of 5 animals per cage.  They received ad libitum a diet feed with a low PABA content ("NAFAG FUTTER" No. 9009 PAB-45, PABA content 45 mg/kg) and drinking water.  On the first day of the test (D0)
the test animals were infected with Plasmodium berghei (strain ANKA).  For this there was used heparinized blood of a donor mouse with about 30% parasitemia, which was diluted with physiological saline such that it contains 10.sup.8 parasitized
erythrocytes per ml.  0.2 ml of this suspension was injected intravenously (i.v.) into the mice to be treated and into the control mice.  In untreated control animals the parasitemia normally reaches 30-40% on the third day after the infection (D+3) and
the test animals die between days +5 and +7.
<BR><BR>The substances to be tested were dissolved or suspended in distilled water or in a mixture of 7% Tween 80, 3% alcohol (96%) and water.  Usually, 0.25 ml of this solution or suspension was administered once subcutaneously and perorally to groups
of 5 test animals.  Treatment was effected 24 hours after the infection.  10 control animals were treated in the same manner with solvent or suspension medium per test.
<BR><BR>All substances were tested in a first test in a single dosage of 10 mg/kg.  Only those substances which in this test (10 mg/kg) had shown a parasitaemia reduction of 90% were used for the titration.
<BR><BR>48 hours after the treatment (D+3), blood smears were prepared from all animals using blood from tail veins and were stained with Giemsa.  The average erythrocyte infection rate (parasitemia in %) in the control groups as well as in the groups
which had been treated with the test compounds was determined by counting under a microscope.  The difference in the average values of the infection rates of control group (100%) and treated groups was calculated and expressed as a percentage reduction
(GI %).  The ED50 or ED90 was determined mathematically by means of the JMP programme (nonlinear fit).  The ED50 (ED90) in mg/kg is that dose which after single administration reduces the average erythrocyte infection rate by 50% (90%) in comparison to
the control group.
<BR><BR>Table 1 below contains the IC50 values measured in vitro for the growth inhibition of chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the human pathogenic Plasmodium falciparum.
<BR><BR>Table 2 below contains data with respect to the activity measured against Plasmodium berghei in mice: GI % is the percentage reduction in the parasitemia after a single dose of 10 mg/kg of the test substance administered perorally (po) or
subcutaneously (sc); ED50 and ED90 are the effective doses of the test substance administered perorally or subcutaneously.
