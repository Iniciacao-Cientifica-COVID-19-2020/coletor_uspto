<BR><BR> 13.  The method of claim 1, wherein the compound is isolated from Oroxylum indicum. <HR> <CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR> This application is a new U.S.  utility application claiming benefit of IN 74/DEL/2006, dated 9
Jan.  2006, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR> This invention relates to identification of Oroxylum indicum, Indian medicinal plant as a rich source for flavanoid compounds.  We have identified mucoprotective and antigastric ulcer properties in the flavone class of compounds.  The invention
also provides a flavanoids mixture obtained in substantial yield from hexane and acetone extracts.  The hexane extract was fractionated, purified and the compounds identified as Oroxylin A, Chrysin and Baicalein.  The acetone extract was purified and the
compounds identified as methoxy chrysin, Oroxyloside methyl ester and chrysin-7-O-methyl glycoside.  Invention of potent antigastric-ulcer compounds were accompanied with synthesis of few analogues derived from the oroxylin and chrysin, which were
isolated from this plant in good yields.  As per the results, oroxyloside methyl ester compound showed potent activity against gastric ulcers induced by aspirin, ethanol, stress and pylorus ligation.
<BR><BR> Gastric or peptic ulcer constitutes a major disease that affects human gastrointestinal tract and major health problem both in terms of morbidity and mortality.  The common clinical features of peptic ulcers are hyperacid secretion and ulcer
formation in the stomach and duodenal part of the intestine.  Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) primarily effects the adult population in developed and developing countries.  The risk for peptic ulcer was highest in generations born before the turn of the
century and has declined in all subsequent generations.  Low family income, old age, smoking lower educational attainment, ethnicity, increased gastric acid output, Helicobacter pylon, NSAIDs and stress are that act as significant and independent basic
risk factors in PUD risk factor.  The prevalence of upper GI diseases is increasing in subjects aged 65 years and over.  Almost 40% of GU (gastric ulcer) and 25% of DU (duodenal ulcer) in the elderly patients are associated with the use of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects include ulcers (found at endoscopy in 15-30% of patients using NSAIDs regularly), complications such as upper GI bleeding (annual incidence of 1.0-1.5%) and development of upper GI
symptoms such as dyspepsia (occurring in up to 60% patients taking NSAIDs).  NSAIDs are among most widely used prescribed drugs world wide for anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects, whereas low dose aspirin (also a NSAID) is used for
cardiovascular prophylaxis.  Although the therapeutic benefits of these drugs are substantial, their use is limited by their gastroduodenal toxicity, some of which can be serious or even fatal.  Established risk factors for NSAIDs induced GI
complications are age, ulcer history, heavy alcohol consumption, individual NSAIDs, dose association with corticoid or aspirin or anticoagulant (ulcer heamorrhage).  The therapeutical acquisition of PUD of the year 2004 is the use of COX-2 inhibitors
reduced significantly the GI side effects of anti-inflammatory treatments.  Since cardiac adverse effects of certain COX-2 inhibitors (NSAIDs) had been reported, the treatments with COX-2 inhibitors came widely into question.  Aspirin is a very useful
medication for the prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with or those at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Patients being treated with aspirin, even at 81 mg/day for cardioprotection, should be assessed for factors that
increase the risk for GI injury.
<BR><BR> Stress has wide spread effects on various body systems.  Stress has long been implicated as one of the risk factors for coronary diseases.  Stress, defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, evokes an adaptive or allostatic response and can have
both a short and long term influence on the function of the gastrointestinal tract.  Stress ulceration of the stomach is associated with clinical conditions like trauma, head injury, burns, shock, sepsis and neurological disorders; and is now regarded as
a multifactorial phenomenon.  It is reported to result from interaction between mucosal, vascular and neuro-humoral factors and the autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role.  Circulatory disturbances and the nutritional deficiency are thus induced
in the local tissue, which are then followed by a rapid appearance of a deep ulcer.
<BR><BR> Gastrointestinal complications frequently occur in patients admitted to the intensive care unit.  Of this ulceration and bleeding related to stress-related mucosal disease can lengthen hospitalization and increases mortality.  The prophylactic
regimen chosen to prevent stress ulcer bleeding should take into account the risk factors and underlying disease state of individual patients to provide the best therapy to those most likely to benefit.
<BR><BR> Ethanol is common cause of acute gastric mucosal injury in both human and animals.  This gastritis may produce life-threatening hemorrhage that requires surgical intervention.  The mortality rate of such an intervention is at least 30%.  In the
rat persistence of gastric mucosal ischemia produces chronic ulceration of the stomach.  Several other factors are associated with ulcer formation although this may be an indirect relationship such factors include hereditary, smoking, elevated calcium
level, corticosteroids in high dose.
<BR><BR> The majority of peptic ulcers causing growing burning or aching pain in the region of the stomach made worse by or unrelated to food.  Pain tends to be worse at night and occurs usually 1 to 3 hours after food during the day.  Additionally there
may be food aversion, weight loss, nausea, belching or bloating.  There is great individual variation and occasionally the pain may be referred to the back or the upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Complications include bleeding, obstruction, perforation or
intractable pain.  Prophylactic options for patients suffering with gastrointestinal ulceration include antacids, sucralfate, histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), prostaglandins, muscarinic M1-antagonists and proton pump inhibitors.  Therapy has been
and still is largely empirical.
<BR><BR> The prostaglandin's fulfilled their early promise and muscarinic M.sub.1-antagonists, although more selective than the earlier anti-cholinergic agents, have limited application.  Inhibition of the H.sup.+/K.sup.+ ATPase by non-competitive agents
is limited to short-term administration and the development of a potent selective gastrin antagonist is yet be realized.
<BR><BR> Reduction of symptoms, nullifying the side effects and improvement in quality of life are among the top priorities of diseases for the suffering persons.  Although these factors need to be considered and balanced in evaluating new therapies for
widespread use.  The reduction in risk in a specific patient population should be considered before a particular regimen is deemed ineffective or too costly.
<BR><BR> The plants create unexpected and novel structure to protect themselves from predator organism.  By trail and error, several plants and plant products are identified as drugs.  Natural product drugs although are highly effective and free from
toxic side effects, have a disadvantage with respect to short supply and chemical structure, which makes their manufacture difficult or impossible.  Natural product drugs have been a source of lead structure in drug design and development.  Semi
synthetic analogues or synthetic analogues closely related to the natural product drug of lead are synthesized and screened to disorder their action.  In the light of above descriptions, in our isolation work flavonoids have been isolated which are
potent antiulcer agents increasing the gastric pH, mucosal lining of stomach and related disorders, led to the identification of Oroxylum indicum, which contained in substantial yields potent antiulcer flavonoids for the first time.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Experimental Protocol
<BR><BR>Process of Isolation of Oroxylin A, Chrysin and Baicalein
<BR><BR> The dried powdered stem bark (200 g) was first defatted with petrol in a soxlet apparatus.  The bright yellow coloured powdered solid was obtained after the filtration of the hexane extract.  The solid (2 g) was chromatographed over silica gel
(60-120 mesh), 3.5 cm dia column loaded to a height of 60 cm.  The column was successively eluted with 1% methanol in chloroform to afford Oroxylin-A. The yield of Oroxylin-A is around 1.2 g. Further elution of the column with 2% methanol in chloroform
afforded chrysin.  The yield of Chrysin is around 0.2 g. Further elution of the column with 3% methanol in chloroform afforded Baicalein.  The yield of Baicalein is around 0.5 g.
<BR><BR> Process of Isolation of Methoxy Chrysin, Oroxyloside Methyl Ester and Chrysin-7-O-Methyl Glycoside:
<BR><BR> The dried powdered stem bark (200 g) was successively extracted with hexane and acetone.  The acetone extract on evaporation afforded a dark brown colored residue (3 g).  The residue was chromatographed over silica gel (60-120 mesh), 3.5 cm dia
column loaded to a height 60 cm.  In addition to oroxylin A, Chrysin and Baicalein two more compounds namely Methoxychrysin, Oroxyloside methyl ester and chrysin-7-O-methyl gluconide were isolated as follows.  The column was successively eluted with 1%
methanol in chloroform to afford Oroxylin-A. The yield of Oroxylin-A is around 0.2 g. Further elution of the column with 2% methanol in chloroform afforded chrysin.  The yield of Chrysin is around 0.25 g. Further elution of the column with 3% methanol in
chloroform afforded Baicalein.  The yield of Baicalein is around 1.5 g. Further elution of the column successively with 4% methonal in chloroform afford Methoxy chrysin.  The yield of methoxy chrysin is around 0.5 g. Further elution of the column with 5%
methonal in chloroform afford Oroxyloside methyl ester.  The yield of Oroxyloside methyl ester is around 0.4 g. Further evolution of the column with 7% methanol in chloroform afford chrysin-7-O-methyl gluconide.  The yield of the chrysin-7-O-methyl
gluconide is around 0.3 g. All the above compounds were isolated in 95% purity.
<BR><BR> The spectrochemical and physical properties of the all the above compounds are discussed earlier.  Further all the synthetic analogues preparation and yields were discussed in earlier procedures.
