<BR><BR> The present invention relate to a novel Bayllis Hillman adduct which are having a remarkable in vitro anti-malarial activity against chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistance Plasmodium falciparum and a process for the preparation
thereof.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Malaria is one of the world's leading killer infectious diseases.  Although almost a third of the Earth's population is considered to be at risk from this disease, about 90% of infections and deaths occur in Africa (Trigg, P. I., and
Wernsdorfer, W. H., Parasitologia: (1999) 41, 329-332), contributing significantly to underdevelopment and poverty on this continent (Gallup, J. L., and Sachs, J. D., Am.  J. Trop.  Med.  Hyg: (2001) 64s, 85-96).  The estimated 300 million cases that
occur per year result in considerable morbidity (e. g. fever, malaise, anorexia, anemia) and mortality of over 2 million children under age group of five (World malaria situation in 1994 part I. Wkly Epidemiol rec: (1997) 72, 269-274.  The intracellular
protozoal parasite Plasmodium falciparum, accounts for greater than 95% of the malarial deaths.  An important contributor to the increase in incidence of malaria over the past 30 years has been the development of resistance of the malarial parasite to
quinoline containing antimalarials such as chloroquine and quinine (Barat, L. M., and Boland, P. B., Drug resistance among malaria and other parasites.  Infet Dis Clin North Am: (1997) 11 (4), 969-987).  In addition, it has been recognized that a number
of complications, such as anemia, failure to gain weight and immunosuppression associated with malaria infection continue to occur for weeks and over months after the parasites are cleared from the body (Ho, M., Webster, H. K., and Looareesuwan, S.
Antigen-specific immunosuppression in human malaria due to plasmodium falciparum.  J. Infect Dis: (1986) 153, 763-771; McGregor, A., and Barr, M. Antibody response to tetanus toxoid inoculation in malarious and non-malarious Gambian children.  Trans R
Soc Trop Med hyg: (1962) 56, 364-367; Bradley-Moore, A. M., Greenwood, B. M. and Bradley, A. K. Malaria chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine in young Nigerian children.  II.  Effect on immune response to vaccination.  Ann Trop Med Parasitol: (1985) 79,
563-573).  For the majority of their life-cycle in humans, malaria parasites live in red blood cells.  Within the erythrocytes, the parasites feed on hemoglobin, digesting the protein and releasing the heme.  The heme which is released as the by-product
of hemoglobin is toxic compound to the parasite.  The malarial parasite having a unique heme detoxication mechanism that the heme is converted to non-toxic heme polymer hemozoin (malaria pigment) within the food vacuole (Rudzinska, M. A., Trager, W. and
Bray, R. S. Pinocytic uptake and the digestion of hemoglobin in malaria parasites.  J. Protozool: (1965) 12(4), 563-576).  Trager, W; Jensen, J. B. Science, (1976), 193, 674) that serves to protect the parasite from potentially toxic free heme, as well
as to induce pathology in the infected host.  Overtime, the intraerythrocytic parasite exhausts this energy and protein supply and then begins next stage of life cycle.  Through a series of DNA and membrane divisions, trophozoites converted to mature
schizonts.  Schizonts-containing erythrocytes rupture, each releasing 6 to 24 merozoites and one large `garbage bag` containing polymerized hemozoin.  It is this process that produces febrile clinical attack.  The released merozoites invade more
erythrocytes to continue the cycle, which proceeds until death of the host or modulation by drugs or acquired immunity.  The 2-chloropyridine based Baylis Hillman adducts and 4-quinolino-methanols are reported to be antimalarial agents.  These classes of
compounds are particularly acting on erythrocytic stage of the parasite.

.mu.l erythrocytes containing 1.5% ring stage parasite in 100 .mu.l complete media.  The culture volume per well for the assay was 100 .mu.l.  Parasitamia was determined for each set of culture, number of parasites for the assay were adjusted at 1 to
1.5% by diluting with fresh O (+) RBC.  Assay was done in 96 well microtitre flat-bottomed tissue culture plates.  Parasite culture was synchronized at ring forms using density gradient method.sup.10 and cultured for 24 h. in the presence of various
doses of compounds and chloroquine for their effect in schizont maturation.  Test was done in duplicate wells for each dose of the drugs.  Control culture was done with RPMI-164 containing 10% AB (+) serum.  Growth of the parasites from duplicate wells
of each concentration was monitored in JSB stained.sup.11 blood smears by counting number of schizont per 200 asexual parasites.  Percent schizont maturation inhibition was calculated by the formula: (1-N.sub.t/N.sub.c).times.100 where, N.sub.t and
