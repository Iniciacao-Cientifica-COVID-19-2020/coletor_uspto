       <p>Patients having a predisposition for thrombus formation are effectively
     treated with compositions of acetylsalicylic acid, citric acid, thiamine
     and/or a zinc salt. The combination of <B><I>aspirin</I></B> and citric acid has been
     found to be significantly more effective in inhibiting platelet
     aggregability than <B><I>aspirin</I></B> alone, and thiamine contributes to the
     reduction in thrombotic potential by reducing plasma fibrinogen levels.
     Accordingly, new methods and compositions are disclosed for reducing the
     thrombotic potential of human or animal subjects, such as in the
     prophylaxis or treatment of atherosclerosis, vascular surgery patients or
     other cardiovascular diseases.

<BR><BR>This invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment or prophylaxis of thrombosis.  More particularly, this invention provides methods and compositions for reducing platelet aggregation and fibrinogen levels in circulating blood
of a patient.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>At least half of the victims of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are asymptomatic until the occurrence of a major vascular obstruction.  Thrombus formation frequently results in the loss of peripheral blood circulation, endangering limb viability,
and potentially in the loss of life.  The risk of thrombus obstruction is particularly pronounced after blood vessel surgery, where thrombus formation and vascular occlusion are relatively common.
<BR><BR>Thrombus formation involves a complex interaction of aggregated platelets and activated coagulation factors with the damaged vessel wall.  Circulating platelets are nonadherent to normal endothelium or to each other, but when the endothelial
lining of a vessel is broken, the platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial collagen.  This is the first step in the formation of hemostatic plugs, and requires participation of a protein made by endothelial cells called the von Willebrand (vW) factor. 
The vW factor is found both in the vessel wall and in plasma, and binds during platelet adhesion to a receptor present on a glycoprotein of the platelet surface membrane.  Next, platelets are activated in reactions initiated by collagen and by thrombin
formed at the injury site.  These stimuli activate phospholipase C, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate.  Products of this reaction activate protein kinase C and also increase the calcium concentration
of platelet cytosol.  As a result, a series of progressive, overlapping events ensue.  The platelets change shape and develop long pseudopods.  A receptor is assembled on the platelet surface membrane, and fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins bind to
this receptor causing platelets to stick to each other.  Arachidonic acid is liberated from membrane phospholipids and undergoes oxidation to products that include prostaglandin H.sub.2 (PGH.sub.2), which serves as an important cofactor for
collagen-induced platelet activation, and thromboxane A.sub.2 (TxA.sub.2), which can act itself as an additional platelet activator.  The contents of platelets are secreted, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP) which can also stimulate platelet
activation and recruit new platelets into the growing hemostatic plug.
<BR><BR>Subsequent to platelet aggregation, fibrinogen in the circulating blood is converted to fibrin to physically tie the hemostatic platelet plug in place.  The platelet surface undergoes a reorganization that exposes procoagulant phospholipids
needed for enzyme/cofactor complexes of blood coagulation to form on the platelet surface.  Secretion of platelet factor V from platelet s-granules provides a key component for one of the enzyme/cofactor complexes.  As a result, thrombin is generated in
increasing amounts on the platelet surface, and converts fibrinogen into fibrin with the formation of fibrin strands that radiate outward from aggregated platelets helping to secure the platelet plug to the site of injury.  Additionally, a mechanism
within the platelets is activated which results in contraction of platelet actinomycin.  This compresses and consolidates the platelet plug, further securing it to the site of injury.
<BR><BR>In the in vivo regulation of thrombus formation, platelet aggregation is mediated by the PGH.sub.2 derivative prostacyclin (PGI.sub.2).  Prostacyclin is also a vasodilator and is believed to render the vessel lining inert to platelet
interactions.  Thus, TxA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 have opposing effects on platelet aggregation, and the degree of the physiological effect of each in the cardiovascular system on the regulation of thrombus formation is determined mainly by their quantitative
balance (Bush, H. L., Jr.  et al., "Favorable Balance of Prostacyclin and Thromboxane A.sub.2 Improves Early Patency of Human In Situ Vein Grafts," J. Vasc.  Surg.  1:149-159, 1984; Coker, S. J. et al., "Thromboxane and Prostacyclin Release From Ischemic
Myocardium In Relation To Arrhythmias," Nature 291:323-334, 1981; Hunter, G. C. et al., "Arterial Wall Thromboxane: Dominance After Surgery Predisposes to Thrombosis," J. Vasc.  Surg.  1:314-319, 1984; and Zmuda, A., et al., "Experimental Atherosclerosis
in Rabbits: Platelet Aggregation, Thromboxane A.sub.2 Generation and Antiaggregatory Potency of Prostacyclin," Prostaglandins 14:1035, 1977).
<BR><BR>Therapeutic treatments to alter thrombus formation have focused mainly on inhibition of the aggregation response.  The most widely accepted agent for this purpose is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), or aspirin.  In the arachidonic acid cascade,
aspirin acts as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to the PGH.sub.2 precursor prostaglandin G.sub.2 (PGG.sub.2).  Since PGG.sub.2 is a precursor to both TxA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2, aspirin blocks both the aggregation
inducing and aggregation inhibiting effects of these factors, respectively.  As an antithrombotic agent, aspirin has had varying degrees of success.  Although minimal amounts of aspirin are required for platelet inhibition, most of the clinical
experience relates to relatively large doses.  The nonselective, potent inhibition of high-dose aspirin on both TxA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 has caused investigators to consider the theoretical advantage of the use of low-dose therapy.  Preferred inhibition
of proaggregatory TxA.sub.2 in humans has been limited to single-dose aspirin administration or short-term cumulative effect.  It has been further found that the degree and duration of aspirin's beneficial effect is highly dependent on each subject's
inherent thrombotic potential (see Zammit, M. et al., "Aspirin Therapy in Small Caliber Arterial Prostheses; Long Term Experimental Observations," J. Vase.  Surg.  1(6 ):839-851, 1984).  For many individuals, aspirin has little or no discernable
antiaggregatory activity, and is not effective in reducing a predisposition for thrombus formation.
<BR><BR>To overcome some of the problems associated with aspirin therapy, it has been previously proposed to utilize certain thromboxane synthetase inhibitors (TSIs), which inhibit the formation of proaggregatory TxA.sub.2 without interfering with the
formation of antiaggregatory PGI.sub.2.  Various imidazole derivatives have been proposed for this purpose, for use either alone or in connection with low dose aspirin therapy.  See, for example, Kaplan, S. et al., "A New Combination Therapy for
Selective and Prolonged Antiplatelet Effect: Results in the Dog," Stroke 17:450-454 (1986).  It has also been suggested that zinc ions exhibit an inhibitory activity toward collagen-induced platelet aggregation and serotonin release in vitro (Chapvil, M.
et al., "Inhibitory Effect of Zinc Ions on Platelet Aggregation and Serotonin Release Reaction," Life Sciences (16):561-572, 1975) and toward platelet activating factor (PAF) in vitro (Arch.  Biochem.  Biophys.  272(2):466-475 (1989); Arch.  Biochem. 
Biophys.  260(2):841-846, 1988), and that hydroxyurea, citric acid and ascorbic acid inhibit plant lipoxygenase activity in vitro (Bekheet, I.A.  et al., " The Effect of Some Inhibitors on the Activity of Lipoxygenase," Alex.  Sci.  Exch.  7(3):389-398,
1986).
<BR><BR>Other therapeutic treatments to alter thrombus formation have involved a reduction in fibrinogen levels, since fibrinogen levels have been shown to be significantly related to cardiovascular risk factors, including blood viscosity, coagulation
and fibrinolysis (see Kannel, W. B. et al., "Fibrinogen and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease --The Framingham Study," JAMA 258 (9):1183-1186, 1987; Wilhelmsen, L. et al., "Fibrinogen as a Risk Factor for Stroke and Myocardial Infarction," N. Eng.  J. Med. 
311 (8):501-504 (1984); and Stone, M. C. et al., "Plasma Fibrinogen --a Major Coronary Risk Factor," J. Roy.  Col.  Gen Prac.  35: 565-569, December, 1985).
<BR><BR>Plasminogen activators, such as streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, directly reduce systemic fibrinogen levels and have been administered by intracoronary, intravenous and/or intramuscular injection for the acute phase treatment of
coronary disorders, such as ischemic stroke and coronary thrombosis.  In addition, fibrinogen degrading agents such as ancrod, a viper venom enzyme isolated from Agkistrodon rhodostoma, the Malaysian pit viper, have been shown to have anticoagulative and
thrombolytic activity when administered by intravenous infusion (see, for example, Hossman, V. et al., "Controlled Trial of Ancrod in Ischemic Stroke," Arch.  Neurol.  40:804-808, 1983; and Apprill, P. G., et al., "Ancrod Decreases the Frequency of
Cyclic Flow Variations and Causes Thrombolysis Following Acute Coronary Thrombosis," Am.  Heart J. 113(4):898-906, 1987).  While plasminogen activators and ancrod have been shown to have some degree of efficacy when administered IV or IM in the acute
phase treatment of thrombotic disorders, they are inappropriate for long term, routine administration in the chronic prophylaxis or treatment of cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>It has now been found that patients having a predisposition for thrombus formation can be effectively treated with compositions comprising aspirin, citric acid, and thiamine, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable zinc salt.  The
combination of aspirin and citric acid has been found to be significantly more effective in inhibiting platelet aggregability than aspirin alone, while thiamine contributes to the reduction in thrombotic potential by reducing plasma fibrinogen levels. 
Accordingly, new methods and compositions are disclosed for reducing the blood thrombotic potential of human or animal subjects.  The new methods and compositions are highly effective in the treatment of cardiovascular patients, such as in the
prophylaxis or treatment of atherosclerosis, vascular surgery patients or other cardiovascular diseases. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a graph of a representative adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation response showing the percent transmission of platelet rich plasma (PRP) as a function of time after induction of aggregation.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is a graph of the ADP-induced platelet aggregation response of PRP with no treatment (baseline, represented by solid dots), and after exposure to sodium citrate (open squares), aspirin and sodium citrate (closed squares), aspirin alone

<BR><BR>In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that therapeutic compositions comprising aspirin and citric acid are significantly more effective for reducing platelet activity than aspirin alone.  In addition, it has been observed
that compositions comprising thiamine are effective for reducing fibrinogen levels.  Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a method for reducing a predisposition for thrombus formation in a patient comprising administering to the
patient a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising aspirin and citric acid.  In another aspect of the invention, a predisposition for thrombus formation in a patient is treated by administering to the patient a therapeutically
effective amount of a composition comprising thiamine.  In one particularly preferred embodiment, a patient is treated by administering to the patient amounts of aspirin, citric acid, thiamine and a zinc salt effective to reduce platelet aggregation and
fibrinogen levels in the blood of the patient, thereby decreasing the likelihood of thrombus formation by at least partially blocking both the platelet aggregation and fibrin formation pathways.
<BR><BR>Other aspects of the invention provide therapeutic compositions comprising an amount of aspirin and citric acid effective to reduce platelet aggregation when administered to a patient and/or an amount of thiamine effective to reduce fibrinogen
levels in the blood of a patient.  In a particularly preferred embodiment, the compositions of the invention comprise aspirin, citric acid, thiamine and a zinc salt.
<BR><BR>The methods and compositions of the invention may be used prophylactically or therapeutically in the treatment of patients who are at high risk of thrombus formation, such as in the treatment of atherosclerosis, vascular surgery patients, and
patients with other types of cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, amounts of acetylsalicylic acid and citric acid effective to reduce platelet aggregation are administered to the patient.  Effective but nontoxic amounts of acetylsalicylic acid and citric
acid may be readily determined by the ordinary skilled physician.  The precise amounts required for this purpose will depend upon the body weight of the patient, physiological condition of the patient, thrombotic potential of the patient, desired effect,
and other factors.  However, for most purposes, at least about 0.5 mg of acetylsalicylic acid per kg of body weight of the patient per day, more preferably from about 2 to about 4 mg of acetylsalicylic acid per kg of body weight of the patient per day,
and at least about 0.5 mg of citric acid per kg of body weight of the patient per day, more preferably from about 2 to about 4 mg of citric acid per kg of body weight of the patient per day is administered to the patient.
<BR><BR>In accordance with another aspect of the invention, amounts of thiamine effective to reduce fibrinogen levels are administered to the patient.  The normal fibrinogen levels in human subjects is dependent upon diet, climate, altitude and other
factors, but commonly ranges from about 200 to about 400 mg/dl of plasma.  With certain disease states, however, the fibrinogen level of a patient can be higher.  In the practice of the invention, individual dosages of thiamine may be determined for each
patient, and are preferably designed to reduce fibrinogen levels in the patient plasma to less than about 350 mg/dl, more preferably less than about 300 mg/dl.  Again, the precise amounts to be administered will depend on many factors.  However, for most
purposes, at least about 0.05 mg of thiamine per kg of body weight of the patient per day is administered to the patient, more preferably from about 0.075 to about 1.25 mg thiamine per kg of body weight of the patient per day of is administered to the
patient.
<BR><BR>In yet another aspect, a patient is treated in accordance with the foregoing and by additionally administering to the patient an amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable zinc salt effective to result in a reduction in platelet aggregability of the
patient.  In most cases, at least about 0.01 mg of the zinc salt per kg of body weight of the patient per day will be effective for this purpose, but significantly larger doses may be employed, if desired.  Suitable zinc salts include, for example, the
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of Zn.sup.2+, such as the hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, gluconic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic, arginine or similar
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.  Presently particularly preferred salts include zinc acetate and zinc sulfate.
<BR><BR>In another aspect of the invention, compositions are provided which comprise amounts of acetylsalicylic acid and citric acid effective to reduce platelet aggregation, and an amount of thiamine effective to reduce fibrinogen levels when
administered to a patient.  In addition, the compositions of the invention may further comprise an amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable zinc salt effective to result in a reduction in platelet aggregability of the patient, as described above, as well
as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.  Preferred compositions of the invention are designed for unit dosage administration, such as, for example, for routine one dose a day administration, and may contain representative amounts of the active compounds
within the following ranges:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ Component Amount (mg/dose)  ______________________________________ acetylsalicylic acid  50-650  citric acid 50-650  thiamine 2-100  zinc salt 0-100  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>In a presently particularly preferred illustrative embodiment for oral administration, compositions of the invention comprise from about 100 to about 200 mg/dose of acetylsalicylic acid, from about 100 to about 200 mg/dose of citric acid, from
about 5 to about 10 mg/dose of thiamine and from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/dose of a pharmaceutically acceptable zinc salt.
<BR><BR>The compositions of the invention can be administered in any effective pharmaceutically acceptable form to warm blooded animals, e.g., in oral, parenteral or infusable dosage forms, in transdermal formulations or as a buccal or nasal spray. 
Suitable parenteral routes of administration include, for example, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of the compounds.  For most purposes, oral administration will be preferred.
<BR><BR>Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules.  In such solid dosage forms, the active compounds may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch.  Such dosage
forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate.  In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. 
Tablets and pills may additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.
<BR><BR>Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water.  Besides such inert diluents, compositions of
the may also comprise adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.
<BR><BR>In addition to the active compounds, compositions according to the invention for parenteral injection may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions.  Examples of suitable nonaqueous
carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate.  Such compositions may also contain adjuvants, such as preserving, wetting,
emulsifying and dispersing agents.  They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in to the compositions.  They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid
compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.
<BR><BR>The foregoing may be better understood in connection with the following examples, which are presented for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>As used in the following examples, platelet aggregations were performed on a Payton dual channel aggregometer with an Omniscribe B-5000 chart recorder with platelet rich plasma (PRP) prepared from venous blood anticoagulated with 3.8% sodium
citrate according to the turbidometric method of Born, GVR, "Aggregation of Blood Platelets by Adenosine Diphosphate and Its Reversal," Nature 194:927-929, 1962.  Platelet aggregations were induced with adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  It has been
previously shown that the rate and persistence of platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate can be used as a measure of the thrombotic potential of blood (see, Kaplan, S., et al., "The effect of Predetermined Thrombotic Potential of the
Recipient on Small-Caliber Graft Performance," J. Vase.  Surg.  3:311-321, 1986, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference).  Using autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP), the platelet count in PRP was adjusted to 250,000 .+-.25,000
platelets/mi.  Following a three minute period at 37.degree.  C., ADP was added to the PRP to a final concentration of 2.5.mu.M, and the change in aggregation response was assessed by degree of inhibition as represented by alteration of the aggregation
curve.  Referring to FIG. 1 (a typical adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation curve depicting percent transmission (% Tran) as a function of time), platelet aggregability (K.sub.agg) was determined by the following equation (1): ##EQU1##
where A.sub.max is the maximum amplitude of the aggregation curve, S.sub.1 is the primary aggregation area (see FIG. 1), S.sub.2 is the secondary aggregation area, S.sub.sum is the total aggregation area (i.e., S.sub.1 +S.sub.2), S.sub.test is a
normalization parameter equal to 64 units.sup.2 and P.sub.c is the whole blood platelet count .times.10.sup.-3.
<BR><BR>Plasma fibrinogen levels were measured by clotting assay using the method of Clauss (Clauss, A., "Gerinnungsphysiologische Schneliomethode zur Bestimmung des Fibrinogens," Acta Haemat.  17:237, 1957).
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR>Sixteen human patients shown to have an inadequate platelet aggregation response to aspirin administration alone, were given daily doses of a composition having the following formulation:
<BR><BR>______________________________________ aspirin 158 mg  citric acid 158 mg  thiamine hydrochloride  8 mg  zinc acetate 1 mg  Total per dose 325 mg  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>The K.sub.agg and fibrinogen level (expressed in mg/dl) of each patient was determined prior to treatment with any medication (No Med) and/or after aspirin treatment alone (ASA), and then again after varying periods of daily administration of a
single dose of the composition set forth above (Post Treatment).  The results are shown in the following Table 1:
<BR><BR> TABLE 1  ______________________________________ K.sub.agg Fibrinogen  ID NM ASA PT BL PT  ______________________________________ 1 nd 17.24 9.34 355 280  2 nd 11.81 8.90 400 335  3 nd 14.44 8.44 513 280  4 nd 9.76 6.27 515 375  5 nd 20.18 12.30

(pretreatment)  nd = not determined  MV = mean value As can be seen from Table 1, the administration of  aspirin (ASA) alone results in a partial reduction in platelet aggregation  (K.sub.agg) in humans, as is known in the art. However, the daily 
administration of a representative composition of the invention  unexpectedly results in a further substantial reduction in platelet  aggregation over that elicited by aspirin alone, as well as a substantial  reduction in fibrinogen levels.
<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR>To demonstrate the effect of various components on platelet aggregation in vitro, six identical samples of platelet rich plasma (PRP) from dog blood were treated with the components described below, induced with a final concentration of 10 .mu.M
ADP and tested for platelet aggregation response, as described above.  The results are shown in platelet aggregation curves of FIG. 2, in which the baseline (no medication control) is represented by solid dots, PRP treated with 2.5 mMol aspirin in
ethanol is represented by open circles; PRP treated with 10 mMol of sodium citrate alone is represented by open squares, PRP treated with 2.7 mMol aspirin and 10 mMol sodium citrate in ethanol and water, respectively, is represented by closed squares;
PRP treated with 10 mMol citric acid alone is represented by closed triangles, PRP treated with 2.7 mMol aspirin and 10 mMol citric acid in ethanol and water, respectively, is represented by open triangles; and controls with PRP treated by 10 .mu.L of
water or 10 .mu.L water and 2.5 .mu.L ethanol are represented by a dotted or dashed line, respectively.  As can be seen in FIG. 2, the combined inhibitory effect of aspirin and citric acid is substantially greater than that of each component separately,
or that of aspirin combined with sodium citrate.
<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR>Fifty mg of thiamine were administered orally to each of five healthy human subjects on a daily basis for a period of two weeks.  The plasma fibrinogen levels of each subject both before and at the end of the treatment period are shown in the
following Table 2:
<BR><BR> TABLE 2  ______________________________________ Fibrinogen After 2 Weeks  Initial Fibrinogen  of Thiamine Administration  Subject #  Level mg/dl Level (mg/dl)  % Reduction  ______________________________________ 1 235 173 26.4  2 255 200 21.6  3
255 195 23.6  4 335 280 16.4  5 315 245 22.2  Mean Value  279 218 22.04  St. Deviat.  43.36 43.15 3.66  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>As shown in Table 2, the daily administration of thiamine resulted in a substantial reduction in the fibrinogen level of each patient, and in an average 22% reduction in fibrinogen levels of all of the subjects studied.
<BR><BR>Example 4
<BR><BR>The procedure of Example 3 was repeated substituting 158 mg of citric acid per day for the thiamine in four healthy human subjects.  The results are shown in the following Table 3:
<BR><BR> TABLE 3  ______________________________________ Fibrinogen After 2 Weeks  Initial Fibrinogen  of Thiamine Administration  Subject #  Level mg/dl Level (mg/dl)  % Deviation  ______________________________________ 1 280 260 -7%  2 248 220 -11.3%

<BR><BR>As can be seen from Table 3, there is no significant correlation between citric acid administration and fibrinogen levels of the subjects studied.
<BR><BR>Example 5
<BR><BR>The procedure of Example 3 was repeated substituting 158 mg of aspirin per day for the thiamine in four healthy human subjects.  The results are shown in the following Table 4:
<BR><BR> TABLE 4  ______________________________________ Fibrinogen After 2 Weeks  Initial Fibrinogen  of Thiamine Administration  Subject #  Level mg/dl Level (mg/dl)  % Deviation  ______________________________________ 1 215 240 +11.6%  2 248 238 -4.0% 3 247 265 +7.3%  4 205 180 -12.2%  Mean Value  228.8 230.8 0.7%  St. Deviat.  22.2 40 10.8  ______________________________________
<BR><BR>As can be seen from Table 4, there is no significant correlation between aspirin administration and fibrinogen levels in the subjects studied.
<BR><BR>Example 6
<BR><BR>Six human patients were selected for treatment after experiencing one or more occurrences of thrombotic vascular occlusion following vascular surgery.  The thrombotic condition of each subject was clinically determined to be inadequately
controlled by conventional aspirin therapy.  Each of the six subjects was judged to be at high risk of subsequent vascular occlusions, and of significant potential for loss of life or limb.  Each subject was placed on a daily treatment regimen of a
single dose of the composition of Example 1.  All of the subjects were routinely examined, and have remained free from clinically observable thrombotic occlusions since beginning the treatment regimen, for periods extending from two months to over 12
months.  Each subject remains free from complications associated with their prior symptoms, and has been judged to have avoided significant hospitalization and medical care which would have otherwise been required.
<BR><BR>The therapeutic effects of the practice of the invention in most human and animal subjects have included a dramatic inhibition of platelet aggregation and decrease in fibrinogen levels, together with a resulting substantial decrease or
elimination of thrombotic occlusion events.  The inhibitory action of the compositions of the invention on platelet activity has been shown to be much more effective than that elicited by aspirin alone.  In addition, the subjective clinical experience in
patients treated according to the invention has been highly favorable as judged by lack of symptoms, a relative freedom from complications and an overall higher quality of life, which is in marked contrast to their pretreatment state.  The methods and
compositions of the invention therefore provide a safe, effective means for the long-term, on-going prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of patients having a predisposition for life threatening thrombus formation, where adequate chronic treatment has
heretofore been unavailable.
<BR><BR>Various modifications and applications of the methods and compositions of the invention will be apparent from the foregoing to those skilled in the art.  Any such modifications and applications are intended to be within the scope of the appended
claims except insofar as precluded by the prior art.
