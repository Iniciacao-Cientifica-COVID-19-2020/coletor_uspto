<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART
<BR><BR> Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy, with a yearly incidence of 14,000 in the United States, constituting 13% of blood cancers and 1% of all human cancers [1].  (The one digit or two digit numbers in the box
brackets, i.e. [1] to [62], correspond to the numbers in the box brackets before each reference disclosed in the related art references section of this disclosure.) MM is unique among most hematological malignancies, with a high capacity to induce
osteolytic bone lesions through the suppression of osteoblastogenesis, stimulation of osteoclastogenesis and the subsequent uncoupling of bone resorption and bone formation in areas adjacent to tumor foci in the bone marrow [2].  The occurrence of bone
lesions is thus one of the major characteristics of MM patients [3]; the number of osteolytic or focal lesions has been associated with clinical disease progression for patients with MM [4].  More than 80% of MM patients suffer from large osteolytic
lesions, and a lack of clinically effective therapeutics leads to the increasing severity of skeletal complications and, indeed, death as a result of lowered resistance to infection (that is, immunodeficiency), hypercalcemia, anemia, and renal failure,
among others [5].  It is estimated that MM, with a median overall survival of 3 to 5 years, accounts for approximately 20% of deaths from hematologic malignancy and 1 to 2% of cancer-related deaths overall [6].  Currently, cure is a realistic goal for
only a small minority of MM patients.  The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with plasma cell malignancy have led to an increased demand for the effective management of this condition.
<BR><BR> It is now generally accepted that MM bone disease is a reflection of osteoblast deactivation [3, 7].  The correction of osteoblast function in the bone of MM patients, therefore, has long been a primary target for the design of therapeutics for
MM-related bone disease.  To this end, bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate, and novel agents, such as lenalidomide, dasatinib, and bortezomib, which inhibit osteoclast activity and/or activate osteoblasts, have been identified for treatment of
MM-induced osteoblast deactivation [2, 8].  Increased knowledge of the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of osteoblast formation and differentiation from MSCs might provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved
in MM-induced osteoblast inhibition and permit the development of more potential therapeutic agents against bone damage [2, 8, 9].  In this regard, novel osteoblast-activating agents, such as dickkopf-1-neutralizing antibody [10] and inhibitor of activin
A signaling [11], are explored for the clinical treatment of MM bone disease.  The combination of traditional cytotoxic and novel agents has led to higher response rates and improved long-term survival compared with treatment with standard doses of
chemotherapy alone.  Unfortunately, not all patients will respond to established novel agents, and even those who do respond will ultimately relapse or become refractory to currently available regimens.  Moreover, large lytic lesions are typically not
repaired, even after long term remission, and relapses often occur in pre-existing lesions [4].  Consequently, additional approaches are urgently needed to achieve systemic bone anabolism and repair large osteolytic lesions.
<BR><BR> The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also called mesenchymal stem cells, to treat MM bone disease has received considerable attention in the field of stem cell research [12].  However, whether MSC infusion inhibits or promotes cancer growth
remains controversial.  A number of in vitro studies suggest that MSCs from MM patients possess abnormal genomic, phenotypic, and functional properties, which might contribute to impaired bone formation in this disease by supporting and protecting MM
cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis [9].  Furthermore, recent evidence shows that MSCs, when injected subcutaneously, promote tumor growth and neovascularization in syngeneic mouse models through directly supporting the tumor vasculature
and secreting proangiogenic factors [13].  Indeed, the promotion of tumor growth through MSCs has also been observed in various cancer models (reviewed in [14]), suggesting that, at least in some specific conditions, MSCs play important roles in tumor
progression.
<BR><BR> In contrast with evidence supporting the fact that MSCs stimulate tumor growth, other studies have documented the routine suppression of tumor growth through MSCs (also reviewed in [14]).  In particular, exogenously administered MSCs effectively
promote bone formation and inhibit bone disease and the growth of highly aggressive MM cells in the bone, although the majority of systemically injected MSCs were localized in the lungs or in draining lymph nodes [15].  Furthermore, intrabone-injected
MSCs have been demonstrated to act as bystander cells to promote bone formation, inhibit osteolysis, and delay MM growth and regrowth [5, 15].  New insights into the effects of in vivo milieu on MSC functions might explain these contradicting results
[16, 17].  Notably, a high dose of melphalan with autologous stem cell support has played an integral part in MM therapy for more than 25 years, either as salvage therapy or to consolidate initial remission, although these therapeutic regimens typically
utilize MM cells as adjuvants for other therapeutic agents [12].  Moreover, after MSC transplantation in over 1,000 patients with a clinically acceptable safety profile, not a single case of MSC-related tumors has been reported in a variety of
indications [14].  Conceptually, it is a small leap from the adjuvant use of stem cells to novel cell-based therapies to enhance the therapeutic outcome of MM, but the idea has only recently begun to gain momentum.
<BR><BR> The clinical and molecular characteristics of MM-related osteolytic lesions support the potential success of cell-based therapies for this disease [5, 12, 15], where the exogenous administration of healthy MSCs might affect MM bone disease via
the secretion of trophic factors, instead of, or in addition to, directly participating in the regeneration of the damaged bone [12].  Gunn and colleagues showed that an interaction between MM cells and MSCs from the bone marrow stroma stimulated the
production of dickkopf-1 and IL-6, resulting in the formation and persistence of osteolytic bone lesions [18].  These authors also showed that the Wnt signaling activator 6-bromoindirubin-3'-monoxime might release MSCs from the osteoinhibitory effects of
Dickkopf-1, enabling released MSCs to repair existing osteolytic lesions [18].  Following the adjuvant use of stem cells for MM therapy [12], Li and colleagues proposed a proof-of-concept that healthy MSCs, independent of other therapeutic agents, might
attenuate the growth of MM and suppress MM-induced bone disease through the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and stimulation of endogenous osteoblastogenesis [5, 15].  Taken together, these data lead to new insights into, and the further exploration of,
stem cell-based therapeutics for MM patients.
<BR><BR> In addition to altering the bone marrow milieu that favors MM cell accommodation, the therapeutic effects of exogenously infused MSCs might also root from healthy MSC-induced MM cell death/apoptosis [5].  However, the underlying crosstalk
between MSCs and MM cells in vitro and in vivo remains unknown.  The execution of programmed cell death is a process triggered through many factors, such as radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and apoptotic signaling, which occurs via intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways.  Both pathways stimulate an intracellular cascade of events leading to cell death.  The intrinsic pathway is initiated by mitochondria, whereas the extrinsic pathway is activated through death receptors that engage their respective
ligands on the surface membrane of target cells.  Fas (DR2/CD95/Apo-1) is a type I cell membrane protein with an extracellular domain that binds Fas ligand (Fas-L) and a cytoplasmic domain that transduces the death signal [19, 20].  Fas-L
(CD95L/CD178/Apo-1 L) is a type II cell membrane protein belonging to the TNF family, which is inducibly expressed in lymphocytes and constitutively expressed in cells present in immuneprivileged organs [21, 22].  Fas-L interacts with its receptor, Fas,
triggering a cascade of subcellular events culminating in apoptotic cell death [23].  Although Fas/Fas-L interactions play an important role in inducing cell apoptosis, it remained unclear whether Fas/Fas-L is involved in the inhibitory effects of
exogenously infused MSCs on MM cells.  The purpose of the present study was therefore to determine whether MSCs exert apoptosis inducing effects on MM cells in vitro and in vivo through altering Fas/Fas-L expression.
<BR><BR> MM is a malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma cells, where B-cell plasmacytomas stimulate osteoclast activity, and hence bone resorption, resulting in progressive osteolytic lesions [18].  Based on studies concerning the pathogenic role of
autoantibodies in MM diseases, recent advances in this field suggest a more central role for B cells in the maintenance of the disease process beyond their roles as precursors for (auto) antibody-producing plasma cells [31].  Particularly, a number of
surface molecules and subsequent downstream signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of MM-related bone destroying events, in which bone resorption and formation are no longer balanced as a consequence of the increased activity of osteoclasts,
but rather the osteoblast activity is reduced, leading to an uncoupled, or severely imbalanced, bone remodeling process [2].  Clinical data have shown that MM patients with advanced bone lesions might show a reduction of bone formation markers, such as
alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, together with increased bone resorption markers, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor .kappa.B ligand (RANKL) and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen [32].  Similarly, marked
osteoblastopenia and reduced bone formation have also been reported in murine models of MM bone disease [33].  These studies demonstrate that MM cells suppress osteoblast formation and differentiation, and consequently inhibit bone formation.
<BR><BR> Recent mounting evidence indicates that MM cells suppress osteoblastogenesis through contact-dependent cell--cell interaction [7, 34] and the production of osteoblastinactivating factors including Wnt inhibitors, such as dickkopf-1 [10] and
secreted frizzled-related protein 2 [35], and cytokines, such as CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha) [11], hepatocyte growth factor, and IL-3/6 [18].  Osteolytic lesions in MM are only observed adjacent to intramedullary plasma
cell foci or plasmacytomas, supporting the idea that MM cells might secrete factors that promote the activation of osteoclasts and the inactivation of osteoblast function to replace bone loss [36].  More effective approaches to cure MM-related bone
disease, in addition to the correction of osteoblast function, should therefore be reflected in therapeutic modalities aimed at inducing MM cell death.
<BR><BR> Researchers in the stem cell field are working to translate the knowledge gained from stem cell biology and function into therapeutic breakthroughs and applications.  It is well known that osteoblasts originate primarily from MSCs and are
responsible for bone matrix synthesis through the secretion of collagen, which forms strands called osteoid [37].  Osteoclast activity is regulated through the expression of cytokines, such as receptor activator of RANKL, which activates osteoclast
differentiation, and osteoprotegerin, which acts as a decoy receptor and inhibits RANKL [38].  Based on this knowledge, MSC-based cytotherapy has established a novel concept for the treatment of MM-related bone disease [39].  Recently, Li and colleagues
demonstrated that both systemic and intrabone cytotherapeutic strategies were effective and clinically applicable for treating MM-related bone disease [15], where weekly systemic injections of MSCs restrained MM disease progression through the ability of
MSCs to traffic to myelomatous bone and survive for a short period of time [5].  Intrabone injections of MSCs, however, not only inhibited tumor growth in the bone with active MM but also effectively promoted bone formation during disease, remission and
delayed MM relapse.  Whether MSCs inhibit or promote cancer growth has developed into a controversy reflected in concern over the use of MSCs, which exhibit a propensity to home to tumors.  Once resident in the tumor microenvironment, these cells support
tumor growth and spread [14], although the ability of cultured MSCs to support long-term growth of primary MM cells is often limited and not reproducible [40, 41].  Therefore, understanding the in vivo milieu in which MSCs either inhibit or enhance MM
cell survival and metastasis is crucial both to safely develop MSCs as a therapeutic tool and to advance our understanding of the role of tumor stroma in carcinogenesis [16, 17].  Moreover, there is still not a general consensus of what defines these
MSCs; the polarization of MSCs into a proinflammatory or an immunosuppressive phenotype showing reversed effects on tumor growth has been observed [17, 42].
<BR><BR> Recent findings suggest that the overexpression of growth differentiation factor 15 in bone marrow MSCs occurs widely in patients with MM.  Tumor microenvironment-derived growth differentiation factor 15 is a key survival and chemoprotective
factor for MM cells, indicating that the behavior of MSCs might be principally determined by the surrounding environment [43].  The two side effects of MSCs on MM cells identified from previous studies are therefore basically acceptable.
<BR><BR> Previous reports have indicated that murine and human MSCs promote breast and coronal cancer growth and metastasis [44, 45].  Interestingly, Ma and colleagues showed that human umbilical cord MSCs significantly inhibited the growth of breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [46].  Furthermore, the ability of cytotherapy through placenta-derived adherent cells to impact bone remodeling and increase bone formation in nonmyelomatous SCID-rab mice has been demonstrated [15].  Intralesional
mesenchymal cell cytotherapy also resulted in inhibiting growth of H929 MM cells and primary MM cells categorized through global gene expression as high risk.  Moreover, placenta-derived adherent cells had no effect on the subcutaneous growth of H929 MM
cells in SCID mice, and did not confer a growth advantage to MM cells co-cultured with placenta-derived adherent cells or supportive MSCs [47].  Recently, adipose derived MSCs, engineered to express the pro-apoptotic ligand TRAIL (also known as TNFSF10),
killed MM cells and migrated towards MM cells in vitro [48].
<BR><BR> It has been well recognized that MSC therapy potentially offers novel therapeutic modalities that are translatable for clinical treatment of a large variety of pathological conditions or diseases [49].  This development is also true for
clinically managing and combating cancer, as MSCs play a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of tumors [5, 50].  MSC administration thus reduces solid tumor growth in mice due to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, probably resulting
from deep modifications of the tumor angiogenesis, regardless of the tumor model and mode of MSC injection [51].  Clinically, current evidence suggests that cytotherapy markedly increases the proportion of MSCs in bone of MM patients, at least for a
short period of time [5, 15].  As deduced from in vitro studies, during this short time, the injected MSCs probably interact with endogenous osteoblast precursors and secrete factors that induce their differentiation into bone-building osteoblasts, while
simultaneously directly interactions with osteoclast precursors to secrete factors that attenuate the formation of boneresorbing osteoclasts [15].  Notably, similar to osteoblasts, MSCs might produce a high level of decorin protein, which inhibits
osteoclast formation and promotes osteoblast differentiation [8].  Following the identification of the potential for MSCs to enhance engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells, increase osteoblast activity and suppress osteoclast activity [52], MSCs
recruited hematopoietic elements that inhibit inflammatory conditions typically associated with MM growth in bone [15].  Along with recent findings in this field [17, 42], it is speculated that MM progression is restrained, directly and indirectly,
through anti-inflammatory factors produced by the injected MSCs or endogenous cells recruited to myelomatous bone after cytotherapy.  The findings that MSCs express high levels of anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic factors, such as SERPINF1 and
decorin, support this concept [5].  Decorin also attenuates MM cell growth [5].  Although certain soluble factors produced by MSCs might mediate part of their therapeutic activities, cytotherapy at a remote site (subcutaneous) was found to have no effect
on MM bone disease or growth [15], suggesting that MSCs must be present in bone marrow to elicit their antimyeloma effects.  Indeed, only MSCs injected directly into bone might efficiently induce an antimyeloma environment.  Systemically injected MSCs
significantly promote bone formation or restrain MM growth because relatively few of those MSCs can transmigrate and traffic to bone [5].  Recent results, however, also suggest that MSCs might be attracted to bone through MM cells or conditions induced
through MM or melphalan treatment.  More importantly, MSCs might be cleared in various tissues, but exhibit higher survival rates in the implanted bone or lymph nodes and therefore could be detected in these tissues at 2 to 3 days after intravenous or
intracardiac injections, respectively [5].  The accumulation of MSCs in lymph nodes, however, might partially explain their immunomodulatory properties.  In fact, evidence suggests that intravenously injected MSCs might localize in the lymph nodes of
experimental mouse models of autoimmunity [53, 54].  This body of work might also explain the fewer numbers and smaller sizes of cancroid pearls in the neck and root tail of the MSC-treated MM mice in the present study.
<BR><BR> Recent studies have revealed that exogenously injected MSCs were not detectable in vivo for long periods of time; the majority of these cells disappeared within 3 to 5 weeks [15, 55].  Clinically, this phenomenon might be advantageous because it
limits the duration of the intervention, and these observations support the notion that most of their activities are mediated through the touch-and-go mechanisms of bystander cells, although proof of such evanescence is thus far not well defined [5, 56]. In support of using allogeneic MSCs for MM, Li and colleagues recently demonstrated that intralesionally injected human placenta mesenchymal cells exert similar therapeutic effects in SCID-rab mice [15].  Together, these studies raise an intriguing
possibility: if we could understand how MSCs induce MM cell death, then perhaps we could exogenously manipulate MSCs to effectively manage MM and saved a large number of lives.  An important, yet unelucidated, question raised by our study is whether a
majority of MSCs transmigrate to the myelomatous bone to kill MM cells after intravenous injection, or traffic to lymph nodes to exert inhibitory effects on MM cells via the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors.
<BR><BR> The potential role of molecules involved in altered B-cell longevity, particularly those involved in apoptosis (for example, Fas/Fas-L modulators), and those that might alter activation thresholds of B cells in the development of autoimmunity,
might contribute to the clinical management of MM [27, 31].  Unfortunately, however, relatively little is known about this issue.  Recently, a number of studies have reported the effects of the Fas/Fas-L pathway on fluoride-induced or melatonininduced
cell apoptosis [57, 58].  Although Mazar and colleagues detected Fas expression on MSCs, stimulation of Fas with different concentrations of anti-Fas antibody did not result in any apoptotic response [23].  Previously demonstrated that caspase-8
deficiency resulted in the inhibition of apoptosis of Jurkat cells, and blocking with Fas Fc protein prevented bone marrow MSC-induced apoptosis in 80% [23].  Other studies have shown that the transformation of the intracellular domain of Fas protein
expressed in human MSCs prevents the trimerization of the receptor and blocks the activation of apoptotic pathway activation [59].  For a further discussion of such mechanisms, see [60]-[62].

<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> This disclosure relates in general to a stem cell treatment.  This disclosure further relates to a stem cell treatment using a composition comprising a stem cell with highly expressed Fas-L. This disclosure also relates to a composition
comprising stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L. This disclosure also relates to preparation of a composition comprising stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L. This disclosure also relates to preparation of a composition comprising stem cells
having highly expressed Fas-L by using a salicylate.  An example of salicylate may be aspirin.  This disclosure further relates to a stem cell treatment of multiple myeloma.  This disclosure also relates to a stem cell treatment of an inflammatory
disease and/or autoimmune disease.
<BR><BR> In one example, a composition may comprise an isolated stem cell having highly expressed Fas ligand (Fas-L).  The isolated stem cell may be mesenchymal stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. In another example, the isolated stem cell may be a
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. Yet, in another example, the stem cell may be a gingiva derived mesenchymal stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L.
<BR><BR> In one example, a preparation method may be a method for preparing a composition suitable for a stem cell treatment of a mammal.  For example, the preparation method may comprise obtaining a tissue comprising a stem cell, treating the tissue to
activate or increase level of Fas-L expression, and thereby obtaining a treated stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L, and preparing a composition comprising the treated stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. The treating the tissue may comprise
separating the tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell, and treating the stem cell.  In another example, the treating the tissue may comprise treating the tissue, separating the tissue into cells, and sorting the stem cell.
<BR><BR> In one exemplary preparation method, the tissue may be treated by using a salicylate.  For example, the treating the tissue may comprise separating the tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell, and treating the stem cell by using a salicylate. 
In another example, the treating the tissue may comprise treating the tissue by using salicylate, separating the tissue into cells, and sorting the stem cell.  In one example, the stem cell may be treated by preparing a solution comprising salicylate and
treating the tissue using the solution comprising salicylate.  The salicylate concentration of the solution may vary in the range of 1 .mu.g/ml to 1,000 .mu.g/ml.  The salicylate concentration of the solution may also vary in the range of 5 .mu.g/ml to
200 .mu.g/ml.  The salicylate concentration of the solution may also vary in the range of 25 .mu.g/ml to 100 .mu.g/ml.  The tissue may be treated for a duration varying in the range of 1 hour to 100 days.  The tissue may be treated for a duration varying
in the range of 1 day to 20 days.  The tissue may be treated for a duration varying in the range of 3 hour to 10 days.  The treating the tissue may further comprise separating the salicylate from the tissue and thereby preparing a substantially
salicylate free composition comprising the treated stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. For the preparation methods, an example of the salicylate may be aspirin.

MSCs, gingiva derived MSCs, or combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> In one example, a treatment method may comprise treating a mammal using the composition comprising the stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. For example, the treatment method may comprise treating the mammal by using the composition
comprising the stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L to treat the mammal that has multiple myeloma (MM).  This treatment may inhibit at least tumor growth.  This treatment may increase survival rate of the mammal that has MM.  Treating the mammal may
comprise using the composition comprising the stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L to treat the mammal that has an inflammatory and/or autoimmune disease.  Examples of the inflammatory and/or autoimmune disease may be graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic sclerosis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), alimentary tract mucositis induced by
chemotherapy, alimentary tract mucositis induced by radiotherapy, or sepsis.  The treatment may increase survival rate of the mammal that has an inflammatory and/or autoimmune disease.  For the treatment method, the stem cell may comprise an MSC.  For
example, the MSC may comprise a bone marrow derived MSC.  In another example, the MSC may comprise a gingiva derived MSC.
<BR><BR> Any combination of inventive features disclosed above may be possible and thereby within scope of this disclosure.  For example, a method of preparing a composition suitable for a stem cell treatment of a mammal, wherein the preparation method
may comprise obtaining a tissue comprising a stem cell, separating the tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell, treating the stem cell, and preparing a composition comprising the treated stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. In another example, a
method of preparing a composition suitable for a stem cell treatment of a mammal, wherein the preparation method may comprise obtaining a tissue comprising a stem cell, treating the tissue, separating the treated tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell,

relates to a treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) using a composition comprising MSCs having highly expressed Fas-L.
<BR><BR> An example of a stem cell treatment was disclosed in a publication by Atsuta et al. "Mesenchymal stem cells inhibit multiple myeloma cells via the Fas/Fas ligand pathway" Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2013, 4:111.  The entire content of this
publication is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR> The stem cell treatment (or stem cell therapy) includes, but is not limited to, diagnosis, treatment, therapy, cure, healing, mitigation, or prevention of a disease or injury in, and/or cosmetic treatment of a mammal.
<BR><BR> The mammal may be a human.  The mammal may be a non-human animal.  For example, the mammal may be a non-human primate, a horse, a sheep, a cattle, a hog, a dog, a cat, and a goat.
<BR><BR> This disclosure relates to a composition.  The composition may be a cell culture.  The composition may be a drug or a biologic formulation.  The composition may be used in the treatment of a disease.  An exemplary composition may comprise a stem
cell having highly expressed Fas-L. An exemplary composition may comprise an MSC having highly expressed Fas-L.
<BR><BR> Stem cells, which are suitable for preparation of the exemplary composition, may be any stem cell of any mammal.  For example, the stem cells may be stem cells of a mammal that undergoes the treatment (i.e. autologous stem cell treatment).  Or,
the stem cells may be stem cells of a mammal other than the mammal that undergoes the treatment (i.e. allogeneic stem cell treatment).
<BR><BR> Examples of the stem cells may be embryonic stem cells, fetal stem cells, adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, cord blood stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, or combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> An example of the stem cells, that are useful in the preparation of the composition, may comprise a mesenchymal stem cell.  Examples of mesenchymal stem cells may comprise bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, dental pulp stem cells, stem cells
from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, periodontal ligament stem cells, dental follicle stem cells, tooth germ progenitor cells, stem cells from the apical papilla, oral epithelial progenitor/stem cells, gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells,
periosteum-derived stem cells, salivary gland-derived stem cells, adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, and combinations thereof.  Examples of the stem cells may be cultured mesenchymal stem cells, uncultured gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells,
dental pulp stem cells, bone-marrow-derived stem cells, and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> One example of the stem cells, that is useful in the preparation of the composition, may comprise a bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC).  Thus, the composition may comprise a stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L, wherein the
stem cell may be the BMMSC.
<BR><BR> Another example of the stem cells, that is useful in the preparation of the composition, may comprise a gingiva derived mesenchymal stem cell (GMSC).  Thus, the composition may comprise a stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. The stem cells
may be the GMSCs.  For isolation of the GMSCs, for example, see Le et al. in a United States patent application publication, entitled "Gingiva Derived Stem Cell and Its Application in Immunomodulation and Reconstruction", Publication No. U.S. 
2012/0128636 A1; and Shi et al. in a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application, entitled "A Composition of Mesenchymal Stem Cells", Application No. PCT/US2014/043918.  The entire contents of these applications are incorporated herein by
reference.
<BR><BR> This disclosure also relates to a method of preparation of the composition ("preparation method").
<BR><BR> One example of the preparation method may comprise obtaining a tissue, separating the tissue into cells, sorting a stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L, and preparing a composition comprising the stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L.
<BR><BR> Another example of the preparation method may comprise obtaining a plurality of tissues, separating these tissues into cells, sorting the stem cells, determining their Fas-L level, and using the stem cells that have higher Fas-L expression level
in the preparation of the composition.  In this example, the plurality of tissues may comprise obtained from different tissues of a mammal.  For example, the first tissue may be a bone marrow tissue and the second tissue may be a gingival tissue.
<BR><BR> Yet, in another example, the tissue or the stem cells may be treated to activate or increase the level of Fas-L expression.  For example, the tissue or the stem cells may be treated with a salicylate to activate or increase the level of Fas-L
expression.  This treatment may activate or increase the Fas-L expression level.  For example, the tissue or the stem cell may be treated with a salicylate to activate or increase the level of the Fas-L expression.  For example, the preparation method
may comprise obtaining a tissue, treating the tissue with a salicylate, and preparing a composition comprising the tissue that may comprise the stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L. In one example, the preparation method may comprise obtaining a
tissue, separating the tissue into cells, sorting the stem cells, treating the stem cells with a salicylate, and preparing a composition comprising the stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L. In another example, the preparation method may comprise
obtaining a tissue, treating the tissue with a salicylate, separating the treated tissue into cells, sorting the stem cells, and preparing a composition comprising the stem cells having highly expressed Fas-L. For the treatment method, an example of
salicylate is aspirin.
<BR><BR> The aspirin treatment of stem cells are disclosed, for example by Yamaza et al. in "Pharmacologic stem cell based intervention as a new approach to osteoporosis treatment in rodents" PLoS ONE.  2008; 3:e2615; and Chen et al. in "Telomerase
governs immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells by regulating FAS ligand expression" EMBO Molecular Medicine, 2014, 6(3), 322-334.  The entire contents of these publications are incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR> The aspirin treatment may be carried out at any aspirin level.  For example, the stem cells may be treated in a solution comprising aspirin.  The solution may comprise aspirin with a concentration varying in the range of 1 .mu.g/ml to 1,000
.mu.g/ml.  The aspirin concentration may vary in the range of 5 .mu.g/ml to 200 .mu.g/ml.  The aspirin concentration may also vary in the range of 25 .mu.g/ml to 100 .mu.g/ml.  The aspirin treatment of stem cells may be carried out for a duration varying
in the range of 1 hour to 100 days.  The aspirin treatment duration may vary in the range of 1 day to 20 days.  The aspirin treatment duration may also vary in the range of 3 days to 10 days.
<BR><BR> In one exemplary preparation method, the salicylate may be separated from the MSCs to obtain substantially salicylate-free MSCs.  These substantially salicylate-free MSCs may be used in the preparation of the composition.  For example, the
substantially aspirin-free MSCs may be used in the preparation of the composition.
<BR><BR> As disclosed in above examples, the preparation method may comprise obtaining a tissue.  The tissue may be any tissue.  For example, the tissue may comprise a mammalian tissue.  In one example, the tissue may comprise a bone marrow tissue.  In
another example, the tissue may comprise a gingival tissue.  The mammal may be a human.  The mammal may be a non-human animal.  For example, the mammal may be a non-human primate, a horse, a sheep, a cattle, a hog, a dog, a cat, and a goat.  The tissue
may comprise a stem cell.  The stem cells may be any stem cells.  For example, the stem cells may be any stem cells disclosed above.
<BR><BR> The tissue may be obtained from a mammal that undergoes the treatment.  In this method, the treatment may be an autologous stem cell treatment.  The tissue may be obtained from a mammal other than the mammal that undergoes the treatment.  In
this method, the treatment may be an allogeneic stem cell treatment.  Combination of said treatment methods may also be applied.  For example, the treatment may comprise an autologous stem cell treatment and an allogeneic stem cell treatment.
<BR><BR> The separating the tissue into cells may be done by a mechanical method, a chemical method, or a combination of a mechanical and a chemical method.
<BR><BR> Examples of the mechanical method may be mincing, shredding, filtering, and the like.  In other examples, the tissue may be separated into cells by using homogenizers, ultrasonicators, ball mills, and the like.  A combination of these mechanical
methods may also be used to have separated cells.
<BR><BR> Examples of the chemical method may be digestion of the tissue by using acids, bases, and enzymes.  For example, a collagenase and a dispase may be used to digest the tissue.  The collagenase may be collagenase type I. The dispase may be dispase
II.  A combination of these chemical methods may also be used to have separated cells.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprise preparing cell suspensions from the digested tissue by using a mechanical method.  An example of such method may be filtering the digested tissue to obtain cell suspensions.  The cell suspensions may
be single-cell suspensions.  For example, single-cell suspensions may be obtained by passing the digested gingival tissue through a 70-.mu.m strainer.
<BR><BR> The culturing the separated cells may comprise providing a solid surface, seeding the cells on the solid surface, culturing the seeded cells, and thereby obtaining a culture comprising cells that may be adherent to the solid surface ("adherent
cells") and cells that may not be adherent to the solid surface ("non-adherent cells").
<BR><BR> The solid surface may be a surface of any solid article.  For example, it may be a wall of a vessel.  The vessel may be any vessel.  For example, the vessel may be a petri dish or a cell-culture dish.  The solid article may also be a bead or a
particle.  The solid article may have any size.  For example, it may be a nano-particle.
<BR><BR> The cell may be seeded using a solution.  The solution may comprise a medium suitable for culturing the mammalian cell.  An example of such medium may be .alpha.-MEM manufactured by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.).  The solution may further
comprise fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprise eliminating from the culture the cells that are not adherent to the solid surface.  For example, the culture may be washed by PBS to eliminate from the culture the cells that are not adherent to the
solid surface.
<BR><BR> The adherent cells may further be cultured, for example, in the same conditions disclosed above.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprise dissociating from the solid surface the cells that may be adherent to the solid surface.  The adherent cells may be dissociated from the solid surface by using an enzyme.  The enzyme, for example, may
be trypsin.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprises expanding the cultured cells.  For example, the expanding the cultured cells may comprise doubling stem cells by repetitively re-seeding them using the preparation methods disclosed above.
<BR><BR> As disclosed in above examples, the preparation method may comprise the separating the tissue into cells and sorting the stem cells.  Some examples of the separating the tissue into cells and the sorting the stem cells are previously disclosed. 
For example, for the separating of the gingival tissue into cells, and sorting and isolating the GMSCs, see Le et al. in a United States patent application publication, "Gingiva Derived Stem Cell and Its Application in Immunomodulation and
Reconstruction" U.S.  2012/0128636 A1; and Shi et al. in a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application serial number PCT/US14/43918, "A Composition of Mesenchymal Stem Cells".  The entire content of these patent applications are incorporated
herein by reference.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprise culturing the separated cells before the sorting stem cells.  The sorting may comprise sorting fluorescein isothiocyanate positive cells as the stem cells.
<BR><BR> The preparation method may further comprise determining the Fas-L expression level of the stem cells.  The Fas-L expression of the stem cells may be determined by using any suitable technique.  For example, the Fas-L expression level of the stem
cells may be determined by using techniques such as a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCT), a Western blotting technique, an immunostaining technique, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA).  The Fas-L
expression level of the stem cells may quantitatively be determined.
<BR><BR> The composition comprising the MSCs having highly expressed Fas-L may be used in the treatment of inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases.  Examples of the inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases may be graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic sclerosis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), alimentary tract mucositis induced by
chemo- or radiotherapy, and sepsis.
<BR><BR> The composition comprising the MSCs having highly expressed Fas-L may also be used in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).  The composition comprising the MSC having highly expressed Fas-L may be used in the treatment of MM in vivo.  The
composition comprising the MSC having highly expressed Fas-L may be used in the treatment of MM in vitro.
<BR><BR> The composition comprising the MSCs having highly expressed Fas-L may be used for tissue regeneration by local implantation or immune therapies by systemic infusion (via vein).
<BR><BR> Other exemplary embodiments of this disclosure are as follows.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Multiple Myeloma Cell Line.
<BR><BR> The 5TGM1 MM cell line used in the present study was subcloned from a stroma-independent cell line originally established from parent murine 5 T33 (IgG2b.kappa.) MMs.  See, for example, LeBlanc et al. "Proteasome inhibitor PS-341 inhibits human
myeloma cell growth in vivo and prolongs survival in a murine model" Cancer Res 2002, 62:4996-5000.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.  The cell line was grown in long-term suspension culture in Isocove's
modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, Calif., USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, Colo., USA) and antibiotics.  In the tracing experiment, MM cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate,
succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen Co.).
<BR><BR> Isolation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
<BR><BR> Bone marrow cells were flushed from the bone cavity of femurs and tibias of B6 mice (C57BL/6 J) with about 2% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, Tex., USA) in PBS, and MSCs positive for CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146, CD166,
Sca-1 and SSEA-4, but negative for CD11b, CD31, CD34 and CD45, were obtained as previously described by Liu et al. "Mesenchymal stem cell-based tissue regeneration is governed by recipient T lymphocytes via IFN-.gamma.  and TNF-.alpha." Nat Med 2011,
17:1594-1601.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.  The cells with MSC character were cultured with alpha minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with about 20% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of about 95% air and about 5% CO.sub.2 at about 37.degree.  C. for about 3 days before co-culture.  See Oyajobi et al. "Dual effects of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha on osteolysis and tumor burden in the
murine 5TGM1 model of myeloma bone disease" Blood 2003, 102:311-319.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.  Additionally, MSCs, which had no Fas-L, were isolated from generalized lymphoproliferative disease (gld)
mice for use in comparative experiments.  B6 and gld mice in the same background (B6Smn.C3-Faslgld/J) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.
<BR><BR> 5TGM1 Multiple Myeloma Model and MSC Administration.
<BR><BR> A 5TGM1 MM model was conducted in weight-matched, 8-week-old to 10-week-old female bg-nu/nu-xid mice from the Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, Me., USA).  The use of animals for research was approved through the Institutional Ethics
Committee/Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California (protocol #10941).  The mice were housed in isolator cages, and autoclaved chow and acidified water were provided ad libitum.  Disseminated MM was induced through the
intravenous inoculation of about 6.times.10.sup.6 5TGM1 cells in about 200 .mu.l PBS in bg-nu/nu-xid mice through the tail vein (about 6.times.10.sup.6/10 g body weight).  After tumor cell inoculation, multiple MM model mice were randomized to receive
the injection of either MSCs (once, about 1.times.10.sup.6 MSCs/10 g body weight) via the tail vein (MSC group) or lymphocyte Peyer's patch adhesion molecules (L-PAM; weekly, about 50 .mu.g/10 g body weight) in the abdominal cavity (L-PAM group), as
shown in FIG. 1A.  See Akiyama et al. "Mesenchymal-stem-cell-induced immunoregulation involves FAS-ligand/FAS-mediated T cell apoptosis" Cell Stem Cell 2012, 10:544-555.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference. 
L-Phenylalanine mustard, or L-PAM, otherwise known as melphalan, is used as the standard treatment in older MM patients.  See Musto P. et al. "Melphalan: old and new uses of a still master drug for multiple myeloma" Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2007,
16:1467-1487.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.  MM model mice with no treatment served as the positive control (MM group).  Original nude mice with no treatment served as the negative control (Control group). 
The 6-week survival rates of the mice in different groups were compared.  After about 4 weeks of feeding, the cancroid pearls in the neck, tail root and abdominal cavity of the mice in different groups were identified for analysis.  For the analysis of
the cancroid pearls, see Oyajobi et al. "Dual effects of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha on osteolysis and tumor burden in the murine 5TGM1 model of myeloma bone disease" Blood 2003, 102:311-319.  The entire content of this publication is
incorporated herein by reference.  For tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry, the animals were housed and provided water and a powdered diet until the time of humane sacrifice.
<BR><BR> Microcomputed Tomography Analysis.
<BR><BR> The cross-sectional volumetric bone mineral density was measured in right femur diaphysis of the mice in each group after about 4 weeks of feeding (for each group, n=6).  High-resolution whole-body radiographs of ketamine anesthetized mice were
obtained with the Inveon microcomputed tomography system (Siemens AG, Bensheim, Germany).  Using two-dimensional images, a region of interest in secondary spongiosa was manually drawn near the endocortical surface, and cancellous bone morphometric
parameters including the bone volume relative to the tissue volume (percentage) and the trabecular thickness (millimeters) were assessed.  A trained observer blinded to the composition of the different groups and treatments received analyzed the number
and surface area of radiolucent lesions.
<BR><BR> Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry.
<BR><BR> Tissue preparation was performed following the publication by Zhang et al. "Mesenchymal stem cells derived from human gingiva are capable of immunomodulatory functions and ameliorate inflammation-related tissue destruction in experimental
colitis" J. Immunol.  2009, 183:7787-7798.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.  The mice were sacrificed after about 4 weeks of feeding.  The samples were immersed in about 4% paraformaldehyde for about 24 hours
and embedded in about 20% sucrose overnight at about 4.degree.  C. The samples were immersed in O.C.T.  compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) for about 2 hours at about 4.degree.  C. and cut into about 6 .mu.m thick bucco-palatal sections using a cryostat at
about -20.degree.  C. For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were blocked for about 30 minutes with about 10% normal goat serum and incubated overnight with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal rabbit Sca-1 IgG (1:100; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA), 7AAD and Annexin V (Apoptosis Detection Kit; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA) at about 4.degree.  C. The other sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and photographed using a light microscope. 
In addition, for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), an apoptosis detection kit (Millipore Co., Billerica, Mass., USA) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
<BR><BR> Cell Culture Conditions.
<BR><BR> To determinate the in vitro cellular effects of MSCs on MM and 5TGM1 MM cells were co-cultured with MSCs directly or under Transwell.RTM.  culture conditions.  For direct co-culture, MM cells were plated at about 5.times.10.sup.5/ml with or
without about 5.times.10.sup.5/ml MSCs for about 0 hour, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, or about 24 hours.  For in-direct co-culture, Transwell.RTM.  culture was used.  Briefly, the upper chamber (about 0.5 ml culture medium) contained 0.5.times.10.sup.5
MSCs, and the bottom chamber (about 1.5 ml medium) contained either the same number or 5 to 10 times that of MM cells.  The Transwell.RTM.  culture without MSCs in the upper chamber served as the control.  In the conditioned culture medium,
0.5.times.10.sup.5 MSCs were cultured for about 3 days.  The supernatant was harvested, added to the MM cultures, and then cultured for about 0 hour, 6 hours, about 12 hours, or about 24 hours.
<BR><BR> Flow Cytometric Analysis.
<BR><BR> After the MM cells were co-cultured with MSCs for about 0 hour, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, and about 24 hours under Transwell.RTM.  culture conditions, the cells were harvested, washed in PBS and incubated with Annexin-V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate and 7AADPerCP for about 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.  Apoptosis was analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur.TM.  flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif., USA), as disclosed by Sun L. Y. "Abnormal surface markers expression on
bone marrow CD34+ cells and correlation with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus" Clin Rheumatol 2007, 26:2073-2079.  The entire content of this publication is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR> Western Blotting.
<BR><BR> Total cell lysates for western blots were prepared after lysing cell pellets in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer.  The lysates were separated through about 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon.TM.-P nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore,
Inc.) and immunoblotted with Fas (about 1:100) or Fas-L (about 1:100) antibodies at about 4.degree.  C. overnight.  The membranes were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (about 1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biosciences,
Santa Cruz, Calif., USA) for about 1 hour, followed by enhancement with a SuperSignal.RTM.  West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo, Rockford, Ill., USA).  The bands were detected on BIOMAX MR film (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y., USA).  Each membrane was
also stripped using a stripping buffer (Thermo) and reprobed with anti-.beta.-actin antibody to quantify the amount of loaded protein.
<BR><BR> Immunofluorescence Staining for Multiple Myeloma Cells or MSCs.
<BR><BR> MM cells and MSCs co-cultured on dishes were fixed in about 4% formaldehyde for about 10 minutes.  For fluorescence staining, the samples were treated in about 0.5% (VN) Triton X-100 (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle, UK) for about 3
minutes and incubated with Annexin V/7AAD.  The other cells were blocked with about 10% normal goat serum for about 30 minutes at about 37.degree.  C. and incubated overnight at about 4.degree.  C. with anti-Fas antibodies (about 1:100; Chemicon
International Inc.  Temecula, Calif., USA) or anti-Fas-L antibodies (about 1:100; Chemicon International Inc.).  The samples were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocynate-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies
for about 2 hours at about 37.degree.  C. Imaging was performed using an Axiotech Microscope (Carl Zeiss Co.  Ltd, Gottingen, Germany).
<BR><BR> Statistical Analysis.
<BR><BR> Data are expressed as mean.+-.standard deviation for two to four parallel experiments separately repeated.  One-way analysis of variance and Fisher's least-significant difference tests were performed.  P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically
significant.  The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice or more to verify the results.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>Effects of MSC Infusion on Multiple Myeloma
<BR><BR> The 6-week survival rates of mice were investigated in this example (for each mice group, n=14).  The effect of MSC administration on the 6-week survival rates of MM model mice is shown in FIG. 1B.  The survival rate of MM model mice, without
any treatment by MSC or L-PAM administration ("MM group"), dramatically decreased until all mice died after about 6 weeks of feeding.  MM model mice with MSC ("MSC group") or L-PAM ("L-PAM group") administration had the similar survival rate during the
6-week observation period (P&gt;0.05).  Although the survival rate of mice in the MSC group or the L-PAM group was lower than that in the Control group (original nude mice without MM cell injection) (P&lt;0.05), the administration of either MSCs or L-PAM
achieved prolonged survival compared with the MM group (P&lt;0.05).  No animal in the negative control group died (the original nude mice that did not receive any treatment) after about 6 weeks of feeding.
<BR><BR> The number and size of cancroid pearls were compared among the four groups (for each group, n=14) after about 4 weeks of feeding, as shown in FIGS. 1C-1D.  No cancroid pearls were identified in the negative control group ("Control group"), but
significant differences in the number and size of the pearls were observed between the MSC group and the MM group (P&lt;0.05).  Although the number of pearls showed no significant difference, the size of the pearls in the L-PAM group was smaller compared
with the MM group (P&lt;0.05).  These data indicated that the MSC administration inhibited both the number and the size of cancroid pearls in the MM model mice.
<BR><BR> Furthermore, bone resorption in the lumbus and collum femoris of mice in different groups was examined and statistically analyzed through microcomputed tomography after about 4 weeks of feeding (for each group, n=3), as shown in FIGS. 1E-1F. 
The bone density (BD) in both the lumbus and collum femoris of animals in the MM group was much lower than those of the MSC group, the L-PAM group, and the Control group (P&lt;0.05).  Although lower than the Control group (P&lt;0.05), no significant
differences were observed between the MSC group and the L-PAM group (P&gt;0.05).
<BR><BR> In addition, MM cell metastasis was determined and quantified in the lungs and kidneys of the MM model mice after about 4 weeks of feeding (for each group, n=5), as shown in FIGS. 1G-1H.
<BR><BR> The rate of metastasis in the lung tissue obtained from mice in the MSC group was much lower compared with either the MM group or the L-PAM group (P&lt;0.05).  As for the metastasis rate in the kidney tissue, no significant difference was
observed among the MM group, the MSC group, and the L-PAM group (P&lt;0.05).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>Effects of MSCs on Multiple Myeloma Cells Under Co-Culture Conditions
<BR><BR> First, three testing co-culture groups were designed, where the number of MM cells was equal to or five to 10 times greater than that of MSCs.  MM cells without MSC co-culture served as the control.  In the control group, the MM cell number
increased 2.5-fold over the initial cell number at about 24 hours after co-culture.  When the initial number of MM cells was equal to or five times greater than that of MSCs, the inhibitory effect of MSCs on MM cell increase was apparent.  However, no
significant MM cell increase was observed when the number of MM cells was about 10 times the number of MSCs, as shown in FIG. 2A.
<BR><BR> To determine whether the reduction was induced through MM cell apoptosis, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in MMs was determined through western blotting.  The increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 was observed in most MM
cells after about 12 hours of co-culture, as shown in FIG. 2B.  The cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in MM cells without co-culture with MSCs was fixed, while the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 in MM cells co-cultured with MSCs
was slightly increased.  Furthermore, the apoptotic rate of MM cells was examined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Annexin V and 7AAD immunofluorescence.  It was observed that the apoptotic rate of MM cells, determined and quantified through
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, was dramatically changed at about 12 hours after co-culture with MSCs (P&lt;0.05), as shown in FIGS. 2C-2D.  In the case of immunofluorescence, the number of positive apoptotic markers in MM cells
significantly increased after about 6 hours of co-culture (P&lt;0.05), as shown in FIGS. 2E-2F.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>Influence of Fas/Fas Ligand Pathway on Multiple Myeloma Cell Apoptosis
<BR><BR> Next, we investigated the different conditions of co-culture with MSCs to confirm the necessity of direct contact between the MSCs and the MM cells for the induction of MM cell apoptosis.  Only the direct co-culture group, which shows direct
contact between MM cells and MSCs, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on MM cell growth (P&lt;0.05), as shown in FIG. 3A.  In addition, the expression of Fas in MM cells and Fas-L in MSCs, determined through western blotting, increased at about 12
hours and about 24 hours (P&lt;0.05), as shown in FIG. 3B.  The data for immunofluorescence staining showed results similar to those of the western blot analysis, as shown in FIGS. 3C-3D.
<BR><BR> MSCs from gld mice, which had no Fas-L, and aspirin treated MSCs, which had high Fas-L, were used to confirm that the enhancement of Fas-L in MSCs increased the apoptosis of MM cells.  Aspirin treatment showed the enhanced expression of Fas-L in
MSCs, as shown in FIG. 4A.  A reduction in the number of MM cells co-cultured with aspirin-treated MSCs was less than that in the normal co-cultured group (co-cultured with normal MSCs) at about 12 hours (P&lt;0.05), as shown in FIG. 4B.  However,
co-culture with the MSCs obtained from gld mice had little influence on MM cell growth.  Furthermore, the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in MM cells co-cultured with aspirin-treated MSCs was significantly increased after about 12 hours.  Under
these conditions, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 was reduced after about 12 hours.  In the case of the gld group, the expression of these proteins remained unchanged, as shown in FIGS. 4C-4D.  The rate of apoptotic cell death
was further investigated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, as shown in FIG. 4E, and immunofluorescence with Annexin V/7AAD, as shown in FIGS. 4F-4G.  Aspirin-treated MSCs showed a greater effect on MM cells than normal MSCs (control group)
(P&lt;0.05), and MSCs obtained from gld mice showed effects similar to those of normal MSCs.
<BR><BR> This example further demonstrated that the treatment of MSCs with a salicylate activated or increased level of Fas-L expression.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 5
<BR><BR>Effects of MSCs Having Highly Expressed Fas Ligand on the Multiple Myeloma Model Mice
<BR><BR> The MSCs obtained from normal, gld or aspirin-treated mice were used to examine the 5-week survival rates of the MM model mice.  The survival rate in the MM model mice treated with aspirin was much higher compared with normal MSC-treated mice
(P&lt;0.05).  The MSCs obtained from the gld mice showed a reduced survival rate, as shown in FIG. 5A.  Furthermore, the number and the size of cancroid pearls were compared among all groups, and both the number and size in the aspirin treated group were
lower compared with the normal group.  However, the gld treated group showed a significantly larger cancroid pearl size compared with the MM model mice without MSC treatment (MM group), although the number of pearls in the MSC gld treated group was less
than that in the MM group, as shown in FIGS. 5B-5C.  The distribution of cancroid pearl size in the MM model mice in each group was shown in FIG. 5D.  Moreover, the presence of MSCs and the apoptosis of MM cells in the pearls of the MM model mice were
observed through immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining.  The presence of MSCs was positive in all MSC injection groups, as shown in FIG. 5E.
<BR><BR> As shown in above examples, treatment of MSCs having highly expressed Fas ligand (Fas-L.sup.high MSCs) indicated remarkable inhibitory effects on MM indenization in terms of extending the mouse survival rate and inhibiting tumor growth, bone
resorption in the lumbus and collum femoris, and MM cell metastasis in the lungs and kidneys.  That is, the levels of Fas-L expression in MSCs may determine, at least in part, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth.
<BR><BR> Above experimental results also indicated that certain phenotypes of MSCs may exhibit inhibitory effects on MM cells, such that the anti-myeloma activity of MSCs can be harnessed or enhanced, for example, via gene-modified approaches.
<BR><BR> Experimental results disclosed in above examples further indicated that MSCs may counterattack MM cells using the same mechanism as observed in other cancer cells; namely, Fas-mediated apoptosis.  Fas and Fas-L are coexpressed on primary MSCs
that might kill co-cultured MM cells.  MM cells might thus be susceptible to the induction of apoptosis through MSCs.
<BR><BR> That is, MSCs may act directly on MM cells, inhibiting their proliferation.  MSC-induced apoptosis in MM cells is evidenced by an increase in the Annexin/7AAD-positive cell population.  Most of this effect can be attributed to the Fas/Fas-L
pathway.
<BR><BR> The activation of both caspase-3 and caspase-8 was observed, suggesting that two main pathways of procaspase activation--the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic death receptor pathway--may both be involved in MSC-induced apoptosis
of MM.  Having determined the effects of MSCs activated through aspirin (having highly activated Fas-L) in the MM model mice, these MSCs resulted in a more effective clinical outcome compared with MSCs from the gld mice.  The MSCs having high Fas-L
expression would be extremely effective in inhibiting MM growth and metastasis.  These experimental results disclosed in above examples indicated that infused MSCs moved immediately to the tumor site.  However, the positive TUNEL reactions within MSCs
from the gld mice were much lower than the others, suggesting that MSCs without Fas-L may have no capacity to kill MM cells.
<BR><BR> Fas-L may be expressed on MSCs to induce MM cell apoptosis under co-culture conditions.  Furthermore, Fas-L activated through aspirin may effectively inhibit the growth and metastasis of MMs in vitro and in vivo.  The additive or synergistic
anti-MM activity of MSCs having highly activated Fas-L, measured on the basis of cell growth, apoptosis, and modest survival improvement of MM-bearing mice, indicating that the levels of Fas-L expression in MSCs may determine, at least partially, the
effect of MSCs on cancer growth.
<BR><BR> Any combination of inventive features disclosed above may be possible and thereby within scope of this disclosure.  For example, a method of preparing a composition suitable for a stem cell treatment of a mammal, wherein the preparation method
may comprise obtaining a tissue comprising a stem cell, separating the tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell, treating the stem cell, and preparing a composition comprising the treated stem cell having highly expressed Fas-L. In another example, a
method of preparing a composition suitable for a stem cell treatment of a mammal, wherein the preparation method may comprise obtaining a tissue comprising a stem cell, treating the tissue, separating the treated tissue into cells, sorting the stem cell,

.mu.g/ml, or in the range of 5 .mu.g/ml to 200 .mu.g/ml, or in the range of 25 .mu.g/ml to 100 .mu.g/ml.  The predetermined salicylate treatment duration may vary in the range of 1 hour to 100 days, or in the range of 1 day to 20 days, or in the range of
3 days to 10 days.  In these examples, an example of a salicylate may be aspirin.  In these examples, the tissue may comprise a bone marrow tissue, a gingival tissue, or combinations thereof.  In these examples, the stem cell may comprise an MSC. 
Examples of MSC may be bone marrow derived MSCs, gingiva derived MSCs, or combinations thereof.  The composition thereby prepared may be used in a treatment of a mammal that has multiple myeloma, an inflammatory and/or autoimmune disease.  Examples of
