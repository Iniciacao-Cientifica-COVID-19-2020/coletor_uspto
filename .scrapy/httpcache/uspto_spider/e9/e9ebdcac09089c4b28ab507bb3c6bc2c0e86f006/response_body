THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to the use of acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) as an antithrombotic agent and as an agent to treat other medical conditions benefiting from suppression of thromboxane levels.  Particularly, the present invention
relates to the percutaneous administration of aspirin for inducing such effects and treating such conditions.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>With the recognition of the role of antithrombotic agents in clinical medicine, investigators have pursued their efficacy, optimal dose, route of administration and safety.  Aspirin has been found to be an effective antithrombotic agent in
patients with cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease.  Aspirin may also have other antithrombotic applications.  Although aspirin has become widely used as an antithrombotic agent, it still exhibits undesirable side effects, including
gastrointestinal toxicity which is probably dose related.
<BR><BR>To induce its suppressive effects, aspirin irreversible acetylates the enzyme cyclooxygenase found in platelets and vascular wall cells [Burch et al., J. Clin. Invest.  61:314 (1978); Majerus, J. Clin. Invest.  72:1521 (1983); Roth et al., J.
Clin. Invest.  56:624 (1975)]. Cyclo-oxygenase converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane-A.sub.2 (TXA.sub.2) in platelets and to prostaglandin-I.sub.2 (PGI.sub.2 or prostacyclin) in vascular walls [see for example, FitzGerald et al., J. Clin Invest. 
71:676 (1983); Preston et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  304:76 (1981)]. TXA.sub.2 induces platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, while PGI.sub.2 inhibits platelet aggregation and induces vasodilation.  In other words, aspirin can have both an
antithrombotic effect (by reducing TXA.sub.2 production) and a thrombogenic effect (by reducing PGI.sub.2 production).  As a result, striking an appropriate balance between aspirin's effects on TXA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 production has been a goal of
aspirin therapy under these circumstances.
<BR><BR>It is generally accepted that when aspirin is administered in doses of approximately 1,000 mg/day, it inhibits both TXA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 synthesis [Weksler et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  308:800 (1983)]. Daily administration of very low doses of
aspirin (approximately 40 mg/day) has been reported to inhibit thromboxane-B.sub.2 synthesis in vitro and to reduce the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane-B.sub.2 (both of which are metabolites of TXA.sub.2), without producing significant changes
in the urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin-F.sub.1 a and 2,3-dinor-6-keto prostaglandin-F.sub.1 a (which are both metabolites of PGI.sub.2 production) [Patrignani et al., J. Clin. Invest.  69-1366 (1982); FitzGerald et al., supra].  While 40 mg/day
has no significant effect on prostacyclin biosynthesis, it does have some measurable effect [FitzGerald et al., supra].  Moreover this dose does not suppress 2,3-dinor-TXB.sub.2 very well and it is not known whether it suppresses bradykinin-stimulated
prostacyclin formation.  Therefore, this dose has not been demonstrated to provide selective inhibition of thromboxane synthesis without also inhibiting prostacyclin formation.
<BR><BR>In contrast, others have reported that equally low doses of aspirin reduced PGI.sub.2 synthesis by 50% in both arterial and venous tissue [Preston et al., supra], and even lower doses (20 mg/day for 1 week) have been reported to inhibit PGI.sub.2
synthesis in both arterial and venous tissue by 50% in atherosclerotic patients [Weksler et al., supra].  It has been proposed that although this differential effect on the inhibition of TXA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 synthesis has been reported when urinary
metabolites are measured to assess inhibition, there is no significant evidence for this differential effect when PGI.sub.2 synthesis is measured by assay of vascular wall biopsy tissue or when the assays for TXA.sub.2 and PGI.sub.2 are performed on
blood samples [Weksler et al., supra].  However, it is not possible to achieve platelet selectivity with standard oral aspirin.  Inhibition of basal PGI.sub.2 biosynthesis is similar over doses of 80-2,400 mg/day and bradykinin-stimulated PGI.sub.2
formation is abolished on oral aspirin 75 mg/day.
<BR><BR>Aspirin has also been found to be an effective treatment for other medical conditions which benefit from lowering of TXA.sub.2 levels.  For example, it has been reported that daily doses of aspirin given during the third trimester of pregnancy
can significantly reduce the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclamptic toxemia in women at high risk for these disorders as a result of reductions in TXA.sub.2 levels [Schiff et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  321:351 (1989)]. Aspirin has also
been reported to provide positive effects in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension.  Low doses of aspirin were reported to selectively suppress maternal thromboxane levels, but only partially suppressed neonatal thromboxane, allowing
hemostatic competence in the fetus and newborn [Benigni et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  321:357 (1989)]. The use of aspirin for reducing the risk of fatal colon cancer has also been proposed [Thun et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  325:1593 (1991)]. Reduction of
thromboxane levels has also been suggested as a means for treating thrombosis in patients having antiphospholipid syndrome associated with lupus [Lellouche et al., Blood 78:2894 (1991)]. Low-dose aspirin has also been suggested as therapy for migraine
headache [see for example, Buring et al., JAMA 264(13) (1990)]. The role of arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., TXA.sub.2 PGI.sub.2) in migraine have also been investigated [see for example, Parantainen et al., "Prostaglandins in the Pathophysiology of
Migraine" in P. B. Curtis--Prior (ed), Prostaglandins: Biology and Chemistry of Prostaglandins and Related Eicosanoids (New York: Churchill Livingstone 1988), pp.  386-401; Puig-Parellada et al., Headache 31(3):156 (1991); Tuca et al., Headache 29(8);498
(1989); Nattero et al, Headache 29(4):233 (1989)].
<BR><BR>The use of aspirin as a thromboxane suppressant has been hampered by its tendency to cause gastric bleeding upon traditional administration of aspirin in oral dose form.  Studies have reported that aspirin produces erythema of the gastric mucosa
in approximately 80% of patients with rheumatic diseases, gastric erosions in approximately 40%, and gastric ulcer in 15% [Silvoso et al., Ann.  Intern.  Med.  91:517 (1979)]. Aspirin applied topically to gastrointestinal tissue damages gastric mucosa
and induces occult gastrointestinal bleeding [Croft et al., Br.  Med.  J. 1:137 (1967)]. Intravenous administration of aspirin may also produce some effects on gastric mucosa which is less pronounced with parenteral than with oral administration
[Grossman et al., 40:383 (1961)]. Oral administration of diluted solutions of aspirin cause considerably less bleeding than similar doses in tablet form, and aspiring solutions containing antacids with sufficient buffering capacity cause no measurable
blood loss [Leonards et al., Arch.  Intern.  Med.  129:457 (1972)]. Enteric-coated aspirin use results in less gastric and duodenal mucosal injury than regular aspirin [Graham et al., Ann.  Intern.  Med.  104:390 (1986)].
<BR><BR>It would, therefore, be desirable to provide an appropriate dosage form of aspirin which will provide thromboxane suppressing effects, preferably selective thromboxane suppressing effects, and will also avoid the adverse side effects observed
with aspirin dosage forms currently employed in aspirin therapies.
<BR><BR>Several reports have been made of the incorporation of aspirin into a various analgesic preparations.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,948,588 discloses the use of ether derivatives of glycerols or polyglycerols as percutaneous absorption accelerators. 
Analgesics, such as morphine, codeine and aspirin, are suggested as possible active agents for use with these accelerators.  An example disclosed incorporation of aspirin into a suppository which was administered to male rabbits.
<BR><BR>U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,654,209 discloses creams containing nitroglycerine and other active ingredients.  Analgesics, such as aspirin, are suggested as active ingredients.  An example makes a cream containing 5-15% aspirin by weight which was applied
to the skin of the abdomen, thigh or back of subjects, resulting in positive blood and urine tests for the active ingredient.
<BR><BR>U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,476,115 discloses analgesic compositions applied to skin together with or subsequent to the application of a non-toxic water-soluble sulfite compound.  Examples described the preparation of mixtures of aspirin and anhydrous
sodium sulfite which was applied to the skin of a mammal and covered with a water impervious plastic sheet held in place by adhesive tape.  Bioavailability was observed within 30 to 40 minutes as evidence by increased mobility of the subject and
reduction of stiffness.  Although such aspirin preparations have been used for their analgesic effects, such preparations have not to applicant's knowledge been applied for therapy in which thromboxane suppression is desired.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>In accordance with the present invention, thromboxane suppressing effects are provided without the gastric side effects normally associated with aspirin therapy.  Aspirin is applied topically to a patient's skin such that it is percutaneously
absorbed.  The aspirin is taken into the bloodstream in quantities sufficient to inhibit TXA.sub.2 synthesis.  The methods of the present invention can be used to treat any medical condition for which suppression of thromboxane levels is beneficial.  For
example, such methods can be used to produce antithrombotic effects and to treat pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclamptic toxemia.
<BR><BR>The aspirin can be applied by use of a support or carrier which contains the aspirin preparation, including without limitation suspensions, creams, solutions, patches (adhesive and non-adhesive), gels, ointments, plasters, plaques or other known
forms for applying topical agents, as long as the aspirin can be delivered in a form which will penetrate the skin (such as, for example, in a solubilized form).  Articles can be made which incorporate the aspirin preparation, in some instances with a
support or carrier (such as in the form of an adhesive patch), which are useful in practicing the therapeutic methods of the present invention.
<BR><BR>Absorption enhancing agents and other pharmaceutical carriers can be incorporated into the aspirin preparation in accordance with known methods.  Propylene glycol, with or without isopropyl or ethyl alcohol, is a preferred carrier.  In addition
to aspirin, other active ingredients can be incorporated into preparations for use in the present invention such as anti-arrythmics, blood pressure regulators, etc.
<BR><BR>The aspirin content of the preparation will vary depending on the form of administration used.  In one embodiment, the aspirin is applied at 750 mg/day at a concentration of about 9% aspirin.  To achieve the desired suppression effects, aspirin
is preferably administered over a period of several days until TXA.sub.2 levels are reduced to minimal levels, preferably less than 50% of baseline levels, more preferably less than 10% of baseline levels, most preferably less than 5% of baseline levels. Although TXA.sub.2 levels will reduced almost immediately, substantial reductions in those levels are achieved and maintained by daily administration over a course of several days, preferably at least 4 days, most preferably at least 10 days.
<BR><BR>Any form of aspirin may be employed in practicing the present invention as long as the active compound can penetrate the skin.  The term "aspirin" as used herein and the apended claims is intended to encompass, without limitations, all such
forms.  Suitable forms may include acetyl salicylate and salts, esters, hydrates, etc. thereof.  Particular salts which may be used include without limitation the lactate, sodium and lysine salts of aspirin.  Compositions and articles of manufacture of
the present invention may also include aspirin in a first form (such as for example, an aspirin "prodrug" or another stabilized compound containing acetyl salicylate) which is later converted to a second form which can penetrate the skin.
<BR><BR>In studying the effects of the methods of the present invention platelet cyclooxygenase activity was used as a measure of aspirin bioavailability, in addition to plasma drug levels.  A preferred vehicle, propylene glycol and ethanol, is widely
used as a skin permeant and was chosen to avoid ex vivo deacetylation to the inactive metabolite, salicylate.  In certain preferred embodiments, aspirin applied daily induced a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase, as measured by serum
TXB.sub.2.  Maximum inhibition was achieved at 10 days and exceeded 95% at the highest dose.  Such a degree of suppression is preferred to sufficiently inhibit platelet function and TXA.sub.2 biosynthesis in vivo.  Inhibition of urinary TX-M followed a
similar pattern.  TX-M is a major enzymatic metabolite of TXB.sub.2 and its excretion is an index of TXA.sub.2 biosynthesis in vivo.  In contrast, the vehicle alone had no effect on serum TXB.sub.2 or urinary TX-M. Following withdrawal of therapy, serum
TXB.sub.2 and TX-M recovered gradually over a period of days.  This is consistent with inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase in vivo.  As the enzyme is inhibited irreversibly, recovery of platelet TXA.sub.2 biosynthesis parallels for formation of new
platelets, a process that has a half-life of 5 days.
<BR><BR>In contrast to the marked inhibition of TXA.sub.2, there was little inhibition of basal or stimulated PGI.sub.2 formation.  Basal PGI-M excretion, an index of in vivo PGI.sub.2 biosynthesis, decreased 24% by day 4 on the highest dose of dermal
aspirin.  No further inhibition occurred despite continued application and by day 10, PGI-M excretion remained at 83% of baseline.  This may reflect the contribution of platelet endoperoxides to PGI.sub.2 biosynthesis or local inhibition of PGI.sub.2
biosynthesis.  PGI.sub.2 formation in response to bradykinin infusion was also unaltered.  In contrast, oral aspirin 75 mg/day suppressed basal and bradykinin-stimulated PGI-M excretion, as previously demonstrated.
<BR><BR>The preservation of vascular cyclooxygenase is consistent with the low bioavailability of the dermal aspirin.  Plasma aspirin and salicylate were determined using a highly sensitive assay that can measure levels of &lt;0.1 ng/ml.  Following oral
aspirin 325 mg or 162.5 mg, peak plasma aspirin levels were 2.0 and 1.3 ug/ml, respectively.  In contrast, following dermal aspirin, plasma levels peaked at 237.+-.114 ng/ml and plasma salicylate peaked at 788.+-.114 ng/ml.
<BR><BR>These data suggest that aspirin applied to the skin is absorbed very slowly, resulting in a delayed onset and offset of activity.  Platelets passing through the site of application are inhibited by relatively high concentrations of aspirin.  A
similar localized platelet effect has been reported with oral aspirin, where inhibition of serum TXB.sub.2 occurs prior to the appearance of aspirin systematically.  As platelet cyclooxygenase cannot recover, cumulative inhibition of all platelets occurs
over time.  In contrast, little aspirin reaches the systemic circulation, so that vascular cyclooxygenase is protected.  The poor systemic bioavailability of dermal aspirin presumably reflects low skin permeability and dilution and inactivation in the
venous and pulmonary circulations.
<BR><BR>Although in one subject there were no histological changes following 10 days of drug application at 250 mg/day, skin reactions were noted in 30% of the subjects, including erthema and peeling.  Similar reactions occur with high concentrations of
salicylate.  Preliminary studies show that reactions may be avoided by alternate day application.  Such regimens have been used without reactions for up to 8 weeks.  Alternatively, modifications to the preparation, such as using the lactate or sodium
salt of aspirin, or the vehicle, may be better tolerated.  Lower concentrations and smaller doses may be feasible under occlusive conditions, which enhance drug absorption.
<BR><BR>When the methods of the present invention are used, as demonstrated further below with respect to certain preferred embodiments, aspirin is absorbed through the skin and results in marked and selective inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase.  This
approach may prove useful in patients with known peptic ulcer disease or during coincident administration of anticoagulants, such as Warfarin or heparin.  The methods of the present invention should be particularly helpful in co-administration with
warfarin as the high incidence of bleeding associated with oral aspirin and Warfarin is gastrointestinal and thought to be secondary to the oral aspirin effect.
<BR><BR>Use of such aspirin preparations in accordance with the present invention provides thromboxane suppression effects, preferably selective suppression effects, without exposing the gut to high local concentrations of aspirin, which should permit
its use in patients with, for example, gastric intolerance, or duodenal or gastric ulcers. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES

<BR><BR>The advantages of the present invention can be appreciated by reference to the following example which is meant to illustrate, but not limit, the present invention.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Five healthy adult volunteers (3 male, 2 female) were studied.  Each refrained from ingesting oral aspirin for two weeks prior to study.  Prior to treatment in accordance with the present invention, baseline thromboxane levels and hemoccults were
obtained.
<BR><BR>Thromboxane levels were measured by assaying for blood levels of thromboxane-B.sub.2 in accordance with the method described in Braden et al., Circulation 82:178 (1990).  Thromboxane levels can also be measured in either blood or urine according
to known methods which include those without limitation disclosed in the following references: Hirsh et al., supra; Robertson et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  304:998 (1981); Pedersen et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  311:1206 (1984); Patrignani et al., J. Clin.
Invest.  69:1366 (1982); Preston et al., 304:76 (1981); Hirsh et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  304:685 (1981).
<BR><BR>Salicylate levels were determined according to the following method.  The procedure for determining salicylate is based on the formulation of a violet colored complex between ferric iron and phenols.  Substances other than salicylate may react to
give a positive test, but false negative results do not occur.  The color reagent contains acid and mercuric ions to precipitate protein.  References relevant to the assay method include: Trinder, Biochemical Journal 57:301 (1954); Tietz, Fundamentals of
Clinical Chemistry, W. B. Saunders Co., 1970, pp.  882-884; Meites, Pediatric Clinical Chemistry, A.A.C.C., 1977, p. 192.
<BR><BR>Trinder's Reagent was prepared as follows, 40 gm of mercuric chloride was dissolved in about 700 ml of deionized water by heating.  The solution was cooled and 120 ml of 1N HCl and 40 gm of ferric nitrate, Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3 9H.sub.2 O, were
added.  When all the ferric nitrate had dissolved, the solution was diluted to a total volume of 1000 ml with deionized water.  This stock solution is stable for approximately one year.
<BR><BR>Standards were prepared as follows.  A Stock Standard (200 mg/100 ml) was prepared by dissolving 464 mg of sodium salicylate in deionized water and diluted to a total volume of 200 ml.  A few drops of chloroform were added as a preservative. 
This standard solution is stable for approximately 6 months under refrigeration.  5, 10, 25, and 40 ml of stock standard were pipetted into a series of 100 ml volumetric flasks, diluted to a total of 100 ml with deionized water, and mixed.
<BR><BR>0.2 ml of serum or heparinized plasma were used as sample specimens.  0.2 ml of each standard and each sample was pipetted into respectively labeled disposable polystyrene tubes.  Into another polystyrene tube, 0.2 ml of deionized water was
pipetted to be used as a reagent blank.  1.0 ml of deionized water was added to all tubes.  1.0 ml of Trinder's reagent was then added to all tubes, which were mixed and let stand tubes for 5 minutes.  The tubes were then centrifuged for 10 minutes.  The
clear supernatant (minimum of 1.0 ml) was placed into respectively labeled 10.times.75 nm cuvettes.  Samples were analyzed by reading % T at 540 nm against the reagent blank set at 100%T.  Sample values were compared with standard values to determine
levels.  Results over 75 mg percent were diluted and re-analyzed.
<BR><BR>A preparation of aspirin in isopropyl alcohol and propylene glycol was prepared by mixing "Aspirsol".TM.  topical aspirin (NDC54102-001-01; commercially available from TERRI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., PO Box 6454, Kingwood, Tex.  77325) in accordance
with the package instructions except that 8 ml instead of 10 ml of the suspending solution was used.  The resulting solution contained approximately 9% aspirin rather than the 7-8% indicated on the package label.
<BR><BR>After base levels of thromboxane had been measured, the aspirin solution was first applied on the morning of Day 1 to the skin of the human subjects within an hour of mixing by rubbing the aspirin solution on the arms and/or chest of the subject. The application was repeated with freshly prepared solution for each of four additional mornings (Days 2-5) in the same manner.  Between applications the subjects followed their normal schedule of bathing and showering.  Eight hours after the fifth
application (on Day 5) blood was drawn for salicylate levels and thromboxane levels to be determined.  With one subject, blood was drawn for TXA.sub.2 levels every day just before application of a new aspirin solution (i.e., approximately 24 hours after
application of the previous aspirin solution).  Hemoccults were also tested.
<BR><BR>Two of the subjects continued daily application for another five days (total ten days).  For Days 6 and 7, aspirin solutions freshly prepared as described above were used.  Beginning with Day 8, a different aspirin preparation was used.  This
second preparation was prepared by crushing aspirin tablets containing approximately 975 mg aspirin to form a powder.  The powder was then formed into a past with approximately 2 ml of distilled water.  This paste was then mixed with 4 ml propylene
glycol and 4 ml ethanol to produce approximately 10 ml of a cloudy solution.  This cloudy solution was then filtered to remove excipients and other insoluble material found in the crushed aspirin tablets.  After filtering, approximately 10 ml of a clear
solution was obtained which contained approximately 9% aspirin.  8 ml of the resulting solution was used in each application.  This second solution was applied to the two continuing subjects as previously described.  Salicylate and thromboxane levels
were checked after the tenth day.
<BR><BR>Thromboxane levels are summarized in Table 1.
<BR><BR> TABLE 1  ______________________________________ Thromboxane Levels  (ng/cc)  Subject  Baseline Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 10  ______________________________________ 1 401 311 250 199 105/35.sup.1  18  2 372 105 12  3 .sup. 107.sup.2 124  4 402

.sup.2 Subject 3 had a very low measured baseline thromboxane level which  is believed to have been a sampling error.
<BR><BR>As summarized in the table, baseline thromboxane levels were found to range from 372-402 ng/cc in four out of five subjects.  The low baseline for Subject 3 is believed to be erroneous and, as a result, the data for Subject 3 was not considered
relevant.  After five daily applications of aspirin in accordance with the present invention, caused a decrease in thromboxane levels of at least 50%.  The two subjects that continued therapy in accordance with the present invention for another five days
had marked suppression by Day 10 of 95 and 97% to levels of 18 and 12 ng/cc.  Salicylate levels in four of five patients on day five were measured as 1 mg percent or less (approx. 1 mg percent being the lower limit of sensitivity of the assay).  All
hemoccults taken were negative.  No gastrointestinal symptoms or other side effects were noted or reported by the subjects.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>Only healthy male and female volunteers were studied.  The subjects were asked to avoid aspirin and any other cyclooxygenase inhibitors for the 10 days before and throughout the period of investigation.  Aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid, USP)
powder was dissolved in propylene glycol and either isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (1.7:1 v/v) to a final concentration of 94 mg/ml.  Preliminary studies demonstrated that aspirin was stable in this vehicle, with less than 1% salicylate detected after 24
hr at room temperature.  The aspirin preparation was made daily immediately prior to its application.  Volunteers attended the clinic where the preparation was applied and were asked not to wash the area for at least 12 hours.  The aspirin solution was
applied to the forearm and upper arm over a 15 min interval.  Volunteers received aspirin 250 mg (n=4), aspirin 750 mg (n=6) or vehicle (n=6) for 10 days and were followed for 8 days following drug withdrawal.  The volunteers were aged 31-56 years, with
equal numbers of male and females in each treatment group.
<BR><BR>Blood without anticoagulant was obtained for serum TXB.sub.2, the stable metabolite of TXA.sub.2, prior to and at intervals during and following aspirin administration.  The blood was allowed to clot in glass at 37.degree.  C. for 60 min and the
serum removed and stored at -20.degree.  C. until analyzed.  Urine was collected over 24 hours at corresponding times for measurement of 2,3-dinor TXB.sub.2 (TX-M) and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF.sub.1a (PGI-M), major enzymatic metabolites of TXA.sub.2 and
PGI.sub.2, respectively [Lawson et al., Analyt.  Biochem.  150:463 (1985); FitzGerald et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  310: 1065 (1984)]. Excretion of these products is an index of the in vivo formation of their parent compounds [FitzGerald et al., supra;
Reilly and Fitgerald, Blood 69: 180 (1987)]. Serum TXB.sub.2 and urinary metabolites were determined by negative ion-chemical ionization, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (NICI-GCMS) using authentic deuterated standards, as previously described
[Braden et al., supra].
<BR><BR>Serum TXB.sub.2, an index of the capacity of platelets to generate TXA.sub.2, was within the normal range in all subjects prior to study, demonstrating that none had been exposed to a cyclooxygenase inhibitor.  Application of the vehicle alone
had no effect on serum TXB.sub.2 in 6 subjects (FIG. 1).  With aspirin 750 mg/day (n=6), there was a progressive reduction in serum TXB.sub.2 in all but one of the volunteers.  In the remaining subjects, serum TXB.sub.2 was 5.+-.3% of baseline by day 10
of application (n=5, p=0.003; FIG. 1).  Aspirin 250 mg/day induced a smaller fall in serum TXB.sub.2, which was 55.+-.11% by day 10 (n=4; p&lt;0.01).  Following the withdrawal of aspirin, serum TXB.sub.2 increased gradually and by day 8 was 93.+-.7 and
65.+-.9% of baseline for aspirin 250 mg and 750 mg, respectively.
<BR><BR>TXA.sub.2 biosynthesis demonstrated a similar response.  Thus, there was a dose dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of TX-M. At 750 mg/day of dermal aspirin.  TX-M declined gradually and was 32.+-.7% of baseline by day 10 )n=5; p=0.002)
of drug application.  By 8 days following drug withdrawal, excretion of the metabolite had recovered to 65.+-.9% of the pretreatment value (FIG. 2).  Despite the evidence of marked inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase, there was only a small fall in
PGI.sub.2 biosynthesis, based on urinary PGI-M determinations (FIG. 3).  Although the changes did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.074 by ANOVA), there was an apparent dose response relationship.  Thus, urinary excretion of PGI-M fell to
84.+-.4% and 76.+-.7% of baseline on aspirin 250 mg/day and 750 mg/day, respectively (FIG. 3).  The peak decrease in PGI-M excretion occurred by day 4 on both doses, in contrast to TX-M excretion.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>In an additional 4 subjects, we examined the increase in PGI.sub.2 formation in response to intravenous bradykinin prior to and following oral aspirin 75 mg or dermal aspirin 750 mg daily for 14 days.  The protocol for bradykinin has been
described previously [Clark, N. Engl.  J. Med 325:1137 (1991)]. Volunteers were admitted after an overnight fast to the Clinical Research Center.  Blood samples were obtained for serum TXB.sub.2 and the subject asked to void.  Through a peripheral vein,
1 liter of normal saline was infused over 1 hour.  After a further hour, bradykinin was infused in incremental doses of 100-800 ng/kg/min, each over 15 min. The infusion was continued at the maximum tolerated dose for a total period of 2 hr.  Blood
pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously.  Urine was collected in separate 2 hr aliquots prior to, during and following the bradykinin infusion.
<BR><BR>Previous studies have demonstrated that bradykinin increases PGI.sub.2 biosynthesis by on average 2-6 fold.  In the 4 subjects studied, bradykinin induced a 5.1.+-.6 fold increase in PGI-M excretion.  Two subjects were treated with oral aspirin
75 mg/day for 14 days and two with dermal aspirin 750 mg/day.  Both preparations caused a marked fall in urinary TX-M M (TABLE 2).  Oral aspirin resulted in a decrease in urinary PGI-M at rest and following stimulation with bradykinin.  In contrast,
resting and stimulated PGI-M excretion was largely unaltered by dermal aspirin.
<BR><BR> TABLE 2.sup.1  ______________________________________ Dermal Aspirin Oral Aspirin  (750 mg/day) (75 mg/day)  PT 1 PT 2 PT 1 PT 2  ______________________________________ TX-M pre ASA 220 121 136 111  post ASA 46 29 26 43  PGI-M pre ASA 163 105

mg/day for 10 days. Urine samples were  collected over 2 hr before (rest) and following the administration of  bradykinin (stim). Dermal aspirin suppressed TXM, but had not effect on  PGIM.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>In 4 subjects (2 male, 2 female) demonstrating a marked (&gt;90%) decrease in serum TXB.sub.2, plasma aspirin and salicylate were determined at timed intervals (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hr) following the application of
aspirin on days 1 and 14.  Aspirin was applied in a dose of 750 mg on one limb over a 15 min interval.  Samples were drawn from the opposite arm.  Blood was withdrawn into heparin (10 U/ml final concentration) and potassium fluoride (5% final
concentration), the latter to prevent ex vivo metabolism of aspirin by plasma esterases.  The plasma was separated immediately and stored at -70.degree.  C. until analyzed.  Aspirin and its metabolite, salicylic acid, were measured by NICI-GCMS using
deuterium-labelled analogues as internal standards, as previously described [Clark, supra].
<BR><BR>Plasma aspirin and salicylate levels were determined following the single application of dermal aspirin in five subjects who demonstrated a marked (&gt;90%) reduction in serum TXB.sub.2.  Plasma aspirin was barely detectable up to three hours
following application when it rose to 237.+-.114 ng/ml.  At six hours, it fell to 52.+-.14 ng/ml and by 24 hours it decreased to 4.+-.3 ng/ml.  Plasma salicylate demonstrated a similar pattern.  At two hours, it was 69.+-.20 ng/ml rising to 250.+-.77
ng/ml at three hours.  At six hours, plasma salicylate was 774.+-.296 ng/ml.  By twenty-four hours, the levels had fallen to 329.+-.84 ng/ml.  The later peak in salicylate levels is consistent with its being derived from aspirin.  Moreover, this
prolonged elevation of plasma salicylate is to be expected, given its longer plasma half-life.  Note that levels following oral aspirin (75 mg) are 1-2 ug/ml.
