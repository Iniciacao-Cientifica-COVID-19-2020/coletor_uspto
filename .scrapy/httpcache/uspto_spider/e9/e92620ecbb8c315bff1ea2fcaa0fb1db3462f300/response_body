       <p>New process for the synthesis of the
     .alpha.-(1-m.ethylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxyacetonitrile of formula (I):
     ##STR1##
     which is known as an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug

     isobutyryl-3,4-dimethoxybenzene of formula (II):
     ##STR2##
     which, by means of the Darzens condensation, gives an epoxyester which, by
     alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation, gives the
     .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetaldehyde. This product is
     reacted with hydroxylamine to obtain the corresponding oxime that, by
     dehydration, gives the nitrile of formula I.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetonitrile is an intermediate useful in the preparation of a drug having coronodilator activity, internationally known as verapamil (INN), described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,261,859.
<BR><BR>The synthesis of the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetonitrile has been described in many patents such a U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,415,866, 3,997,608 and 4,593,042, Canadian Patent 986946, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No.
78092732, European Publication No. 0165322 and Hungarian Patent HUT 032064.
<BR><BR>The primary method, described in the Canadian and Hungarian Patents, in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,593,042 and in the Unexamined Japanese Publication, consists in the alkylation of the homoveratronitrile by means of an isopropyl halide, in the presence of
many kinds of alkaline agents and in different solvents.  In U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,415,866 and 3,997,608, homoveratronitrile is reacted with acetone in the presence of sodium ethoxide and the resulting isopropylidene derivative is catalytically
hydrogenated.  Finally, in the above mentioned European Publication, the nitrile is obtained by reacting the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-benzylchloride with sodium cyanide.
<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>An object of the present invention is a new method for the synthesis of the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetonitrile of formula (I): ##STR3## starting from the isobutyryl-3,4-dimethoxybenzene of formula (II): ##STR4## which
undergoes the Darzens condensation with an alkyl ester of an .alpha.-haloacetic acid, in the presence of an alkoxide of an alkali metal or of sodium amide or sodium hydride, to give an .alpha.,.beta.-epoxyester of formula (III): ##STR5## wherein R
represents a straight or branched alkyl radical, containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, which, by alkaline hydrolysis, gives the alkali salt of the epoxyacid of formula (IV): ##STR6## wherein Me.sup.+ corresponds to a cation of an alkali metal, preferably
sodium or potassium, which, by decarboxylation, gives the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetaldehyde of formula (V): ##STR7## which, by treatment with hydroxylamine, gives the corresponding oxime of formula (VI): ##STR8## which is
dehydrated, for instance in the presence of acetic anhydride and optionally of potassium acetate, to give the desired .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetonitrile of formula I.
<BR><BR>The process object of the present invention can be carried out without isolating and characterizing the various intermediates of the foregoing formulae; however, if it is desired, the various steps of this process can also be carried out
separately, by isolating and characterizing the relevant intermediates.
<BR><BR>The intermediates of formulae III, V and VI are new and therefore they constitute a further object of the present invention.
<BR><BR>The process object of the present invention consists in reacting a molar equivalent of isobutyryl-3,4-dimethoxybenzene of formula (II): ##STR9## with from about 0.5 to about 5 molar equivalents of an .alpha.-haloester of formula (VII):
<BR><BR>wherein X represents a halogen atom, preferably a chlorine atom and R represents an alkyl radical, straight or branched, containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, ethyl or 2-butyl, in the presence of from about 0.5 to about 5 molar
equivalents of a base selected from an alkoxide of an alkali metal of formula (VIII):
<BR><BR>wherein Me.sup.+ represents the cation of an alkali metal, preferably sodium or potassium, and R.sub.1 represents an alkyl radical, straight or branched, containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, sodium amide or sodium hydride.  The preferably used
bases are sodium methoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium 2-butoxide and potassium 2-butoxide.  The reaction takes place in a period of time comprised from about 1 to about 24 hours at a temperature comprised from about -25.degree.  C. to the boiling
temperature of the reaction mixture.  The reaction can be carried out with or without solvents.  Suitable solvents are the aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably toluene, and the alcohols, straight or branched, containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or their
mixtures.
<BR><BR>The glycidic ester of formula (III): ##STR10## which forms during the reaction, wherein R has the above meaning, generally is not isolated but it is transformed into the alkali salt of the epoxyacid of formula (IV): ##STR11## wherein Me.sup.+
corresponds to a cation of an alkali metal, preferably sodium or potassium, by means of an alkaline hydrolysis carried out by treating the solution containing the epoxyester of formula III with an alkali or an alkaline-earth base, preferably sodium or
potassium hydroxide, for a period of time comprised from about 1 to about 12 hours at a temperature comprised from about 0.degree.  C. to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture.
<BR><BR>The salt of the epoxyacid of formula IV is then decarboxylated at a temperature comprised from about 20.degree.  C. to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture for a period of time comprised from about 1 to about 16 hours.  In this way the
.alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetaldehyde of formula (V): ##STR12## is obtained.  By treating the aldehyde of formula V with a molar equivalent of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, at a temperature comprised from about 0.degree.  C. to the
boiling temperature of the reaction mixture for a period of time comprised from about 0.5 to about 16 hours, the corresponding oxime of formula (VI): ##STR13## is obtained.
<BR><BR>The desired nitrile of formula I is obtained by dehydrating the oxime of formula VI.
<BR><BR>According to a preferred method, a molar equivalent of oxime of formula VI, optionally dissolved in a solvent selected among acetic acid, toluene, 2-butanol, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide, preferably in acetic acid, is reacted with from
about 1 to about 4 molar equivalents of acetic anhydride optionally in the presence of from about 0.1 to about 2 molar equivalents of sodium acetate at a temperature comprised from about 20.degree.  C. to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture
for a period of time comprised from about 1 to about 48 hours, giving the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetonitrile of formula (I): ##STR14## pure enough to be used without any further purification for the synthesis of the verapamil. 
However the nitrile can further be purified by distillation under vacuum or by crystallization.
<BR><BR>In a preferred aspect of the invention, the .alpha.-(1-methylethyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzeneacetaldehyde of formula V is not isolated from the reaction medium because, as it forms by decarboxylation of the salt of the epoxyacid of formula IV, it is
reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, thus directly transforming itself into the oxime of formula VI which is extracted from the reaction medium by means of an organic solvent, preferably toluene.
<BR><BR>The .sup.1 H-NMR spectra of the products of formulae III, V and VI, which are to be new and that therefore constitute a further object of the present invention, have been carried out in CDCl.sub.3 with a Bruker CXP 300 spectrometer, by using
tetramethylsilane as reference substance.  The symbols used have the following meaning: d=doublet; m=multiplet; q=quartet; s=singlet; t=triplet. <BR><BR>The examples below reported constitute an explanation of the present invention but are not to be
considered as a limitation thereof.
