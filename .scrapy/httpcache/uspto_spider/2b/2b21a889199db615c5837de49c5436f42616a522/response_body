<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>1.  Field of the Present Disclosure
<BR><BR> The present disclosure relates to novel crystalline forms of (R)-(+) Verapamil hydrochloride.
<BR><BR>2.  Description of Related Art
<BR><BR> Verapamil HCl (e.g., 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl-methylamino]-2-pr- opan-2-ylpentanenitrile) is a known drug with various medicinal indications.  Traditionally, it is used for treating coronary disease, such as
hypertension.  The compound has a stereogenic center, hence can be separated into its optical enantiomers.  The (S)-enantiomer is known to possess the majority of the calcium channel antagonist activity, whereas the (R)-enantiomer is known to possess
agonist activity toward somatostatin receptor 2, and antagonist activity toward orexin receptors 1 and 2, dopamine D.sub.2L receptor, sodium and calcium channels; accordingly, the (R)-enantiomer is useful as a medicament for treating diseases or
conditions related to these receptors in a human subject.  Therefore, single isomer products may offer clinical utility on medical conditions related to those receptors and/or ion channels.

construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
<BR><BR> The present disclosure is aimed to obtain the crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl by a crystallization process, which in general, involves dissolving (R)-(+) verapamil HCl in a solvent until saturation, and cooling the saturated solution to
precipitate the desired crystal therefrom.  The obtained crystal is then subject to X-ray diffraction crystallographic analysis.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, the crystals of the present disclosure respectively yield a characteristic powder X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), and each crystal has a specific value of 2.theta..
<BR><BR> In a powder X-ray diffraction pattern, I.sub.max denotes the most intense peak in the powder X-ray diffraction chart measured in a powder sample of a crystal, whereas I denotes an intensity of each peak.  The value of 2.theta.  of the powder
X-ray diffraction pattern can vary by approximately 0.1.degree.  to 0.5.degree.  with the state of the sample and measuring conditions.  Because of properties of data of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern, general pattern is important for identifying
the crystal form.  Further, since a relative intensity can slightly vary with the growth direction of crystals, size of particles and/or measuring conditions, the intensity values in the XRD pattern should not be strictly interpreted.
<BR><BR> The main objective of the present disclosure is to provide novel crystalline forms of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl.
<BR><BR> To prepare novel crystalline forms of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl, (R)-(+) verapamil HCl is dissolved in suitable solvent(s) until a saturated solution is obtained; and the saturated solution is then cooled to form novel crystals therefrom.
<BR><BR> According to embodiments of the present disclosure, at least 24 types of solvents have been tested, and among them, only 3 solvents meet the solubility criteria set forth in the examples of the present disclosure, and accordingly, 2 novel
crystalline forms of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl are prepared.
<BR><BR> Examples of solvent suitable for preparing novel crystalline forms of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl may be ethyl acetate, toluene, or a 1:1 volumetric mixture of 1,4-dioxane and heptane.
<BR><BR> According to one embodiment, a novel crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl is prepared from a saturated ethyl acetate (EtOAc) solution.  (R)-(+) verapamil HCl crystalizes from the saturated EtOAc solution is termed "form E crystal," which yields
a powder X-ray diffraction pattern comprising characteristic peaks of 12.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 18.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 19.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 20.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree., and 21.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta.. 
According to a further example, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the form E crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil hydrochloride further comprises characteristic peaks of 6.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 8.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
10.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 15.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 15.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 20.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 23.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 24.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 25.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
25.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 27.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 27.0.degree..+-.0.1.degree., and 29.8.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta..  Specifically, it yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern as substantially depicted in FIG. 2. 
Thermal analysis indicates a phase change occurred at an endothermic temperature from about 139.+-.0.1.degree.  C. Hygroscopic analysis indicates the form E crystal may pick up 21% moisture at about 95% RH, as compared to about 30% of the non-crystalline
form of verapamil hydrochloride.
<BR><BR> According to another preferred embodiment, a novel crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl prepared from a saturated toluene solution.  (R)-(+) verapamil HCl crystalizes from the saturated toluene solution is termed "form T crystal," which yields a
powder X-ray diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks of a powder X-ray diffraction pattern comprising characteristic peaks of 8.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 9.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 21.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., and
22.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta..  According to a further example, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of form T crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil hydrochloride further comprises characteristic peaks of
5.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 9.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 15.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.1.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 21.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 21.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 23.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 24.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  and
25.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta..  Specifically, it yields a powder X-ray diffraction pattern as substantially depicted in FIG. 3.  Thermal analysis indicates a phase change occurred at an endothermic temperature from about
132.+-.0.1.degree.  C. Hygroscopic analysis indicates the form T crystal may pick up about 23% moisture at about 95% RH, as compared to about 30% of the non-crystalline form of verapamil hydrochloride.
<BR><BR> Impurity of the form E or T crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl is verified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the impurity level of the crystal of the present disclosure is
reduced after each cooling and crystallizing step.  Preferably, the individual impurity level of the crystal is less than 1.0%; more preferably, less than 0.5%; still more preferably, less than 0.1%.  In the context of the present disclosure, the
crystalline of the present disclosure having an impurity level less than 1.0% means that the crystal has less than 1.0% of other non-(R)-(+) verapamil HCl compounds; the crystalline of the present disclosure having an impurity level less than 0.5% means
that the crystal has less than 0.5% of other non-(R)-(+) verapamil HCl compounds; and the crystalline of the present disclosure having an impurity level less than 0.1% means that the crystal has less than 0.1% of other non-(R)-(+) verapamil compound.
<BR><BR> Any crystal thus obtained can be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient of a medicine.  Any of the crystal may be used alone or as a mixture of both forms.
<BR><BR> In the present disclosure, the use of form E or T crystalline of (R)-(+) verapamil HCl is advantageous for handling and storage stability as compared with the case of using no crystal.  Particularly, the form E or T crystalline of
(R)-(+)-verapamil HCl is easily handled because of its crystal form, and the purification and drying effect is easily exerted; also, the crystal has improved storage stability and is useful as an active pharmaceutical ingredient of a medicine.

<BR><BR> The present disclosure will now be described in further detail with reference to the following examples.  However, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the specified examples.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Materials.
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was purchased from Syn-Tech Chem. & Pharma Co.  Ltd (Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.)
<BR><BR> Crystallization.
<BR><BR> Crystallization was carried out by slow and/or fast cooling from a hot saturated solution.  In general, about 30 mg (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was dissolved in the least volume of indicated solvents, including those listed in the following Table 1,
and others, such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetic acid, and etc, at 53-70.degree.  C. until all powders were completely dissolved.  The temperature varied with the choice of solvent, in the case when EtOAc was used, about 30 mg of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl
powders were dissolved in the least possible volume of EtOAc at 53-60.degree.  C.; in the case when a mixture of 1,4-dioxane/heptane (1:1) was used, the powders were dissolved at 60.degree.  C.; whereas if toluene was used, then the powders were
dissolved in least amount of toluene and heated to about 70.degree.  C. till the powders were completely dissolved.  The solution was then placed in two different vials and subject to fast and slow cooling, respectively.  For slow cooling, the vial was
left to cool down to room temperature (about 25.degree.  C.); as to fast cooling, the vial was immediately placed in an iced bath to cool to about 4.degree.  C. Both solutions, either in the fast or slow cooling, were let stand for no more than 3 days.
<BR><BR> Thermal Analysis.
<BR><BR> The crystal was subject to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis over the range of 30.degree.  C./300.degree.  C. with a gradient of 10.degree.  C./min under nitrogen purge, and the presence or absence of endotherm peaks was observed.
<BR><BR> Similarly, the crystal was also subject to thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis over the range of 30.degree.  C./350.degree.  C. with a gradient of 10.degree.  C./min under nitrogen purge; and weight loss, decomposition, and phase transition of the
crystal were observed.
<BR><BR> The melting point of the crystal was determined using a capillary method (e.g., Thomas-Hoover or the Mel-Temp apparatus).  In general, a few crystals were placed in a thin-walled capillary tube about 10-15 cm in length, and about 1 mm in inside
diameter, and closed at one end.  The capillary, which contained the sample, and a thermometer were then suspended so that they were heated slowly and evenly.  The temperature range over which the sample was observed to melt was taken as the melting
point.
<BR><BR> X-ray Powder Diffractometry.
<BR><BR> X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on D2 phaser X-ray diffractometer system (Bruker AXS Gmbh, Germany).  Samples were scanned in continuous mode from 5-50.degree.  (2.theta.) with step size of 5.theta./min on a spinning stage at 30 kV and
10 mA with Cu K.alpha.  radiation (1.54056 .ANG.).  The incident beam path was equipped with a 1 mm divergence slit and 1 mm air scattering screen.  The diffracted beam was equipped with Ni-filter.  Detection was accomplished with a Lynxeye (2.5)
detector (Bruker AXS).
<BR><BR> Hygroscopicity.
<BR><BR> Hygroscopicity was determined by dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) performed on the DVS Advantage (Surface Measurement Systems Ltd., London) DVS is a technique that measures how quickly and how much of a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent)
being absorbed by a sample.  Measurements were taken from 0 to 95% RH at 25.degree.  C. with 5% RH per step with equilibration set to dm/dt+0.002%/min for 5 min or 120 min/step.  All samples reached equilibration at each step before the 120 min maximum
set point was reached.
<BR><BR> Storage Stability.
<BR><BR> Crystal samples were placed in an environment of (a) 40.degree.  C./75% RH, open vial; (b) 50.degree.  C., airtight container; and (c) 4,500 LUX, respectively, for 1, 7 and 21 days, and thereafter subjected to high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to determine the level of impurity.
<BR><BR>Example 1 Preparation of New Crystal Forms of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl
<BR><BR> In this example, the commercial available (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was subject to polymorph screening so as to identify new crystal forms of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl.
<BR><BR> 1.1 Polymorph Screening
<BR><BR> The commercial available (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was dissolved in various types of solvents as indicated in Table 1, and solubility was visually assessed.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Solubility of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl in various types of solvent Solubility # Solvent (mg/ml) 1 acetone &gt;20 2 ACN &gt;20 3 DMSO &gt;20 4 H.sub.2O &gt;20 5 n-propanol &gt;20 6 MEK &gt;20 7 1,4-dioxane &gt;20 8 EG &gt;20 9

acetate; MEK: methyl ethyl ketone; THF: tetrahydrofuran.
<BR><BR> Among the 24 types of solvents that were tested, the solubility of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl differed from one solvent to another, it varied from "quite soluble," "soluble," "soluble to just a minor extend," to "insoluble." Specifically,
(R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was found to be quite soluble in water, acetone, DMSO, MEK, ACN, n-propanol, 1,4-dioxane, ethylene glycol, H.sub.2O/IPA (1:1), H.sub.2O/THF (1:1), H.sub.2O/acetone (1:1), EtOH/DCM (1:1), EtOH/heptane (1:1), and toluene/MetOH (1:1);
soluble in DCM, DMF, IPA, THF, EtOH/MEK (1:1), 1-butanol; soluble to just a minor extent in EtOAc, toluene, 1,4-dioxane/heptane (1:1); and insoluble in heptane.  Thus, EtOAc, toluene, and 1,4-dioxane/heptane (1:1) were chosen as the solvents for
subsequent crystallization.
<BR><BR> 1.2 Preparation of Form E Crystal
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was dissolved in EtOAc and crystallized in accordance with the procedures described in "Materials and Methods" section.
<BR><BR> The crystal was subject to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis, and was termed "form E."
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 illustrates the X-ray diffraction pattern of form E crystal, in which major diffraction peaks were observed at approximately 12.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 18.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 19.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
20.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree., and 21.2.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta.; minor diffraction peaks were observed at approximately 6.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 8.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 10.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
15.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 15.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 20.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 23.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 24.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 25.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 25.9.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
27.0.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 27.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., and 29.8.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta..  The XRD pattern of form E crystal of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (FIG. 2) appeared to be quite different from that of the control (i.e.,
the commercial (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl, FIG. 1).
<BR><BR> As to thermal analysis, DSC analysis indicated a phase changed occurred at endothermic temperature at about 139.+-.0.1.degree.  C. (see FIG. 4).  TGA analysis indicated a weight loss of about 1.70% before 150.degree.  C. We thus concluded that
form E was a new crystal form of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl.
<BR><BR> 1.3 Preparation of Form T Crystal
<BR><BR> (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl was dissolved in toluene and crystallized in accordance with the procedures described in "Materials and Methods" section.
<BR><BR> The crystal was subject to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis, and was termed "form T."
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 illustrates the X-ray diffraction pattern of form T crystal, in which major diffraction peaks were observed at approximately 8.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 9.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 21.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
and 22.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta.; and minor diffraction peaks were observed at approximately 5.4.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 9.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 15.7.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 17.1.degree..+-.0.1.degree.,
21.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 21.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 23.3.degree..+-.0.1.degree., 24.6.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  and 25.5.degree..+-.0.1.degree.  at reflection angles 2.theta..  The XRD pattern of form T crystal of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl (FIG. 3)
appeared to be quite different from that of the control (i.e., the commercial (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl, FIG. 1).
<BR><BR> As to thermal analysis, DSC analysis indicated a phase changed occurred at endothermic temperature from about 132.+-.0.1.degree.  C. (see FIG. 5).  TGA analysis indicated a weight loss of about 3.63% before 150.degree.  C. We thus concluded that
form T was also a new crystal form of (R)-(+)-verapamil HCl.
