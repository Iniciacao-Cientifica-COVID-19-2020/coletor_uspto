       <FONT size="+1"> Beta-carotene vitamin E therapy for inhibition of major vascular events
</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p>This invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the occurrence of a
     major vascular event in a subject whereby a subject is administered
     beta-carotene and/or vitamin E, either alone or in combination.
     Beta-carotene and/or vitamin E is administered such that the subject's
     risk of experiencing a major vascular event is thereby reduced. In another
     preferred embodiment, beta-carotene in combination with <B><I>aspirin</I></B> is
     particularly effective.
The invention further includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising
     beta-carotene in combination with vitamin E.

<BR><BR>1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>The invention generally relates to the field of medicinal chemistry.  More specifically, the invention relates to the administration of beta-carotene and/or vitamin E to inhibit the occurrence of a major vascular event.  The invention is further
directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising beta-carotene in combination with vitamin E. In one embodiment, beta-carotene is administered in combination with aspirin.
<BR><BR>2.  Brief Description of the Background Art
<BR><BR>Despite a recent decline in cardiovascular disease-related mortality, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in men and women in the United States, accounting for 47% of all deaths in 1986 (Dept.  of Health
and Human Services, Mortality Part B 88-1114:170-95 (1988).
<BR><BR>Recent evidence suggests that antioxidant therapy may prevent or impede atherogenesis.  Free radical oxidation has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease (Steinberg et al., N. Engl.  J. Med.  320(14):915-24
(1989)).  Serum lipoproteins can become oxidized in vivo (Warso et al., J. Clin. Invest.  75:667-71 (1985)) and these may be more atherogenic than their unoxidized counterparts.  Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) can potentially promote
atherogenesis by several mechanisms.  First, these modified lipoproteins may be toxic to or alter function of arterial endothelium.  Oxidized LDL is cytotoxic to cultured endothelial cells as well as fibroblasts in vitro (Hessler et al., Arteriosclerosis
3(3):215-22 (1983); Yagi, K., Bioessays 1:58-60 (1984)).  This altered endothelium may permit diffusion of serum lipids into the subendothelium and/or alter the ability of the endothelium to prevent thrombosis.  Second, oxidized LDL chemotactically
attracts and immobilizes monocyte/macrophages (Quinn et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  82:5949-53 (1985)), some of which are destined to become lipid-laden foam cells within atheromatous plaque (Schaffner et al., Am.  J. Pathol.  100:57-73 (1980);
Gerrity, R. G., Am.  J. Pathol.  103:181-90 (1981)).  Finally, oxidized LDL is taken up into foam cells via a scavenger receptor more readily than unoxidized LDL (Fogelman et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  77:2214-18 (1980); Goldstein et al., Proc. 
Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  76:333-37 (1979)).  Thus oxidation of LDL may play an important role in the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis.
<BR><BR>Recent attention has focused on agents that may prevent the oxidation of LDL and thus impede or retard the progression of atherosclerosis.  When incubated in various cell preparations, LDL will become oxidized (Morel et al., Artheriosclerosis
4:357-64 (1984); Cathcort et al., J. Leukocyte Biol.  38:341-50 (1985)).  This process can be inhibited by the addition to the cell preparation of antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene or vitamin E (Morel et al., Artheriosclerosis 4:357-64
(1984); Steinbrecher, et al., Arteriosclertosis 1:135-43 (1987)).  LDL taken from patients treated with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering agent with lipid antioxidant properties, does not become oxidized in an endothelial preparation that does oxidize LDL
from untreated patients (Parthasarathy et al., J. Clin. Invest.  77:641-44 (1986)).  This in vitro data suggests that antioxidant therapy may reduce the rate of in vivo lipid oxidation.  In addition, after controlling for its lipid-lowering effect,
probucol reduced the rate of fatty-streak formation in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (Carew et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  84:7725-29 (1987)).
<BR><BR>Beta-Carotene
<BR><BR>Beta-carotene is naturally occurring provitamin A with lipid antioxidant properties.  In addition, beta-carotene is lipid soluble and is concentrated in circulating lipids and atherosclerotic plaques.  Patients treated with a six week course of
160 mg of beta-carotene daily had a 50 fold increase in beta-carotene level within carotid plaques excised at the time of endarterectomy (Prince et al., Circulation 78:338-44 (1988)).
<BR><BR>In vitro, beta-carotene is an unusual type of chain breaking lipid antioxidant (Burton et al., Science 224:569-73 (1984)).  Because of its many conjugated double bonds, beta-carotene exhibits good radical trapping antioxidant behavior only at
oxygen tension below 150 torr.  Physiologic oxygen tension are typically below 100 torr.
<BR><BR>There are few dietary studies on the association of beta-carotene to atherosclerotic disease.  A cross-cultural study failed to show any association between serum beta-carotene levels and ischemic heart disease (Kok et al., Am.  J. Clin. Nut. 
45:462-68 (1987)).
<BR><BR>Beta-carotene has virtually no important side effects.  No biochemical or hematologic abnormalities were noted in 133 patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria treated with an average of 180 mg per day (doses as high as 300 mg per day) for as
long as five years.  The only reported side effect was skin discoloration, which is not evident at lower doses.  In addition, one patient reported loose stools, which cleared spontaneously (Mathews-Roth et al., Arch.  Dermatol.  113:1299-1232 (1977)).
<BR><BR>Vitamin E
<BR><BR>Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is a fat soluble vitamin found in vegetable oils, egg yolk, milk fat, nuts, and cereal grains.  Its primary functions is felt to be as a lipid antioxidant protecting lipids from oxidative modification.
<BR><BR>In vitro data confirm the ability of vitamin E to prevent the oxidation of lipids.  During incubation with cultured endothelial cells, the LDL particle undergoes various structural changes that will alter its metabolism.  These changes are
dependent on lipid peroxidation as an initial step.  This oxidative modification can be totally inhibited by the addition of vitamin E to the cellular preparation (Morel et al., Atherosclerosis 4:357-64 (1984)).
<BR><BR>Cross-cultural studies suggest an association between lipid standardized vitamin E levels and ischemic heart disease.  In a large cross-cultural survey in which serum was collected from 903 randomly selected males aged 40-49 to determine the
relationship of cholesterol-standardized vitamin E levels to rates of ischemic heart disease in six study populations (Gey et al., Am.  J. Clin. Nutr.  45: 1368-77 (1987)), the vitamin E level within the plasma lipoproteins as indicated by the vitamin
E/cholesterol ration revealed significant inverse correlation to the ischemic heart disease mortality rate in each study population.  In a nested case-control study of Dutch men, no significant associations between serum vitamin E levels and
cardiovascular disease mortality were noted (Kok, et al., Am.  J. Clin. Nut.  45:462-68 (1987)).  However, vitamin E levels were not lipid standardized.  In animal studies, restricted ovulatory hens, which develop hyperlipidemia and subsequent aortic
intimal thickening, were fed 1000 mg of vitamin E per Kg of feed (Smith et al., Atherosclerosis 75:105-09 (1989)).  Compared to controls, those fed a vitamin E diet had reduced levels of plasma peroxides and less aortic intimal thickening.
<BR><BR>Variable results have been obtained from randomized clinical trials using vitamin E in various forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.  After 40 months of treatment with 600 mg of vitamin E daily in patients with claudication, 13 of 17 in the
treatment group compared to only 2 of 17 in the placebo group showed improvement in symptoms (Livingston et al., Lancet.  2:602-04 (1958)).  These results have been confirmed in subsequent randomized trials (Haeger et al., Am.  J. Clin. Nutr.  27:1179-81
(1974)).  A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study among patients with angina pectoris failed to show a benefit after six months of therapy with 1600 mg of vitamin E daily (Gillilan et al., Am.  Heart J. 93:444-49 (1977)).
<BR><BR>Vitamin E is a safe drug with few clinically important side effects.  Animal studies have shown that vitamin E is not carcinogenic or teratogenic (Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, Washington DC, (1975)).  In human
studies few side effects have been reported in double-blind protocols and other large studies, even at high doses (Anderson et al., Am.  J. Clin. Nutr.  27:1174-78 (1974); Hole et al., J. Am.  Diet.  Assoc. 86:625-29 (1986)).  Although oral intake of
vitamin E at doses of 1200 mg/day may increase bleeding time in cardiac patients on warfarin (Corrigan et al., J.A.M.A.  230:1300-01 (1974), vitamin E has not been shown to produce any coagulation abnormalities at lower doses among patients on warfarin
or at any dose among individuals who are not vitamin K-deficient.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>We have discovered that the administration of Beta carotene and/or Vitamin E, either alone or in combination, to a subject, inhibits the occurrence of one or more major vascular events in the subject.  Major vascular events include, myocardial
infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization procedure and cardiovascular death.
<BR><BR>In particular, we have discovered that the occurrence of one or more major vascular events in a human subject that has experienced or is predisposed to experience angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft and/or percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty, is inhibited by the administration of beta-carotene and/or vitamin E to the subject.
<BR><BR>This invention is further directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the synergistic combination of beta-carotene and vitamin E. The combination of beta-carotene and vitamin E is particularly useful in the therapeutic methods of the
invention.
<BR><BR>In yet a further embodiment, beta-carotene is administered in combination with aspirin. <BR><BR>FIGURES
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a graphic representation of relative risk adjusted for age and aspirin assignment of major vascular events in the beta-carotene group, as compared with the placebo group, according to year of follow-up in the trial.  Vertical bars

<BR><BR>FIG. 1 also shows that the effect of beta-carotene is chronic, not acute, and that beta-carotene delays the progression of atherosclerosis. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>A preferred method of the invention includes the administration of beta-carotene and/or vitamin E to a subject such that the occurrence of one or more major vascular events is thereby inhibited.
<BR><BR>Another preferred method of the invention includes the administration of a composition comprised of the synergistic combination of beta-carotene and vitamin E to a subject such that the occurrence of one or more major vascular events is thereby
reduced.  Included as well in the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprised of beta-carotene and vitamin E in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
<BR><BR>More specifically, by the term "inhibiting" is intended both prevention and amelioration of the disease state.  Thus the invention comprises both a therapeutic and a prophylactic modality.
<BR><BR>By the term "major vascular events" is generally intended atherosclerotic vascular disease and its related illnesses.  In particular, major vascular events includes myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization procedure and
cardiovascular death.
<BR><BR>By the term "beta-carotene" is intended beta-carotene and the biologically active analogs thereof.  Typical analogs include molecules which demonstrate equivalent biological function but which differ structurally.  Such analogs include
canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein and lycopene.
<BR><BR>By the term "vitamin E" is intended vitamin E and the biologically active analogs thereof.  Typical analogs include molecules which demonstrate equivalent biological function but which differ structurally.  Such analogs include all other
tocopherols.
<BR><BR>By the term "aspirin" is intended aspirin and the biologically active fractions thereof.
<BR><BR>By the term "a composition of beta-carotene in combination with vitamin E" is intended any composition comprising beta-carotene or beta-carotene analogs, and vitamin E or analogs of vitamin E.
<BR><BR>By the term "a composition of beta-carotene in combination with aspirin" is intended any composition comprising beta-carotene or beta-carotene analogs, and aspirin or analogs of aspirin.
<BR><BR>By the term "subject" is intended all mammals, in particular humans.
<BR><BR>By the term "administration" is intended the administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention by any means that achieve their intended purpose.  For example, administration may be by parenteral, subcutaneous,
intravenous, intramuscular, intra-peritoneal, transdermal, or buccal routes.  Alternatively, or concurrently, administration may be by the oral route.  The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of
concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.
<BR><BR>Compositions within the scope of this invention include all compositions of 500 mg or less of beta-carotene, in combination with 5000 mg or less of vitmamin E; and all compositions of 500 mg or less of beta-carotene, in combination with 2400 mg
or less of aspirin, in an amount which is effective to achieve its intended purpose.  While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is with the skill of the art.  Typically, beta-carotene and/or
vitamin E may be administered to mammals, e.g. humans, orally at a dose of 25-300 mg per day of beta carotene and 100-3200 mg per day of vitmin E, or an equivalent amount of beta-carotene, vitamin E and the beta-carotene/vitamin E composition, per day of
the body weight of the mammal being treated for major vascular disorders.  Preferably, about 50 mg of beta-carotene and/or 600 mg of vitamin E are orally administered to treat or prevent such disorders.
<BR><BR>The unit oral dose may comprise from about 0.25 to about 500 mg, preferably about 3 to about 100 mg of beta-carotene; about 5 to about 5000 mg, preferably about 100 to about 1000 mg of vitamin E; and about the same relative amounts of each for
the composition combining beta-carotene and vitamin E. The unit dose may be administered one or more times daily or on alternate days.
<BR><BR>In addition to administering beta-carotene and/or vitamin E as a raw chemical, the compounds may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical preparation containing suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients and auxiliaries which
facilitate processing of beta-carotene and/or vitamin E into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.  Preferably, the preparations, particularly those preparations which can be administered orally and which can be used for the preferred type of
administration, such as tablets, dragees, and capsules, and also preparations which can be administered rectally, such as suppositories, as well as suitable solutions for administration by injection or orally, in dose ranges that provide similar
bioavailability as described above, together with the excipient.
<BR><BR>The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner which is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes.  Thus, pharmaceutical
preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain
tablets or dragee cores.
<BR><BR>Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well
as binders such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone.  If desired,
disintegrating agents may be added such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.  Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating
agents and lubricants, for example, silica, talc, steric acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol.  Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings which, if desired, are resistant to gastric
juices.  For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent
mixtures.  In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used.  Dye stuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets
or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses.
<BR><BR>Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol.  The push-fit capsules can contain the active
compounds in the form of granules which may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers.  In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably
dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, or liquid paraffin.  In addition, stabilizers-may be added.
<BR><BR>Possible pharmaceutical preparations which can be used rectally include, for example, suppositories, which consist of a combination of the active compounds with a suppository base.  Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or
synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons.  In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which consist of a combination of the active compounds with a base.  Possible base materials include, for example, liquid triglycerides,
polyethylene glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons.
<BR><BR>Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts.  In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection
suspensions may be administered.  Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides.  Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances
which increase the viscosity of the suspension include, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran.  Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>Having now described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR>A study was conducted in which a randomized trial of aspirin was tested for its effect on the reduction of cardiovascular mortality; and beta-carotene (provided as LUROTIN.TM.  by BASF) was simultaneously tested for its effect on the reduction of
cancer incidence.  The trial was conducted entirely by mail among 22,071 male physicians, aged 40 to 84, who were randomized to take either a 325 mg aspirin or placebo tablet every other day alternating with a capsule containing 50 mg beta-carotene or
placebo.  The trial thus used a 2.times.2 factorial design, with each participant taking one pill daily (Stampfer et al., Stat.  Med 4:111-16 (1985)).
<BR><BR>The 261,248 potentially eligible physicians, identified from an age-targeted list provided by the American Medical Association, were sent letters of introduction, consent forms and enrollment questionnaires.  A total of 33,223 doctors enrolled in
an 18-week run-in phase.  Participants took daily pills from calendar packs containing active aspirin alternating with beta-carotene placebo.  This run-in period enabled the identification and elimination of poor compilers and those who could not
tolerate aspirin before randomization, thus increasing the power of the study.  At the end of the run-in, a total of 22,071 (66%) were randomized to aspirin, beta-carotene, both or neither.  Use of the run-in strategy appears to have been quite
effective.  At 60.2 months of follow-up, (averaged for participants, ranging from 45.8 to 77.0) over 90% of all participants reported taking 50% or more of their study pills for the entire duration of the trial, 86.7% were still taking the
beta-carotene/placebo capsules, and 84% were still taking the aspirin/placebo tablets.  Not a single participant has been lost with respect to mortality follow-up, and 99.7% are still providing information on morbidity.  The blinded aspirin component of
the study was terminated prematurely due primarily to the emergence of a statistically extreme benefit of aspirin on both fatal and nonfatal MI (The Steering Committee of the Physicians' Health Study Research Group, N. Engl.  J. Med.  318:262-64 (1988)),
while the beta-carotene component is still ongoing.
<BR><BR>Of particular relevance to the present invention are the studies concerning beta-carotene's role in cardiovascular disease.  These studies were conducted among the subgroup of participants who entered the trial with a history of angina pectoris
or coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), and indicated a marked and statistically significant benefit of beta-carotene in reducing subsequent vascular events among this high-risk population.
<BR><BR>The results, as set forth in Table 1, indicate that the reduction of risk for patients taking beta-carotene, as compared to placebo, did not occur until beta-carotene had been taken for a long period of time.
