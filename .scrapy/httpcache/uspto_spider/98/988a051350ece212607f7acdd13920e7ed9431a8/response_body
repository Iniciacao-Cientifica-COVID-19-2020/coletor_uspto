<BR><BR> This application is a national phase entry under 35 USC 371 of International Patent Application No.: PCT/IB2016/052648 filed on 10 May 2016, which claims priority from Indian Application No. 1864/MUM2015 filed on 12 May 2015, the disclosures of
which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyl) methyl-amino-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl valeronitrile, which is known as Verapamil and the hydrochloride salt thereof.  The present invention
also relates to a process for improving the purity of verapamil hydrochloride by efficient removal of the impurities formed.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Verapamil, or 5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyl)methyl-amino-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopro- pyl valeronitrile has been known for more than 20 years and its synthesis is described in Belgian Pat.  No. 615 816 corresponding to the Dengel U.S.  Pat. 
No. 3,261,859.
<BR><BR> ##STR00001##
<BR><BR> The hydrochloride of verapamil is used in medicine for its remarkable antagonistic properties against intracellular penetration of calcium.  It is an important drug for the treatment of angina pectoris when the attack is associated with a
coronary spasm and beta-adrenolytic products such as propanolol, timolol, atenolol and pindolol are liable to have undesirable effects.  It is also useful in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac arrythmia.  It is known to the man of the art that the
pharmacological action of verapamil is proportional to its concentration in the plasma (Br.  J. Clin. Pharmac.  (1981), 12, 397-400) and that the optimum therapeutic range extends from 100 ng/ml to 400 ng/ml of plasma.
<BR><BR> Verapamil is presently in clinical use as the racemate and is used extensively for the treatment of hypertension.  The opposite enantiomers of verapamil have different biological activities.  The (S)-enantiomer (levoverapamil) has the majority
of the calcium channel antagonist activity (DE-A-2059923) whilst the (R)-enantiomer (dextroverapamil) differs in having sodium channel and other cell-pump actions in addition to higher bioavailability, with slower clearance rate.  Verapamil is a known Ca
channel blocker and is a competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.  Processes for the preparation of verapamil are disclosed in several prior art documents such as U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,261,859 and U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,418,017.  Verapamil obtained according to
the procedure disclosed in these prior art documents involves the formation of a dimer along with various O-desmethyl and N-desmethyl derivatives of verapamil as impurities, which reduces the purity of verapamil and also lowers the yield due to repeated
purification by multiple and elaborate crystallization processes.
<BR><BR> The yield is reduced during the process of repeated purification.  Therefore a need was felt to develop an efficient process of preparation of verapamil and further its hydrochloride, wherein the impurities formed during the process can be
easily separated out without the requirement for repeated crystallization of the final product, thereby making the process of the present invention simple, efficient, cost-effective and industrially feasible.
<BR><BR> The object of this invention is to provide an alternative process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride, the compound represented by Formula I herein, which process of the present invention will allow efficient large-scale synthesis by
overcoming the drawbacks of the conventional technique involving formation of impurities.
<BR><BR>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> An object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride represented by formula I, which improves upon the limitations of the prior art process.
<BR><BR> An object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride by selective crystallisation, which enables effective removal of impurities formed, affording a product of higher purity.
<BR><BR> An object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride, with purity greater than 99%.
<BR><BR> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride which is simple, efficient, cost-effective and industrially feasible.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride represented by formula I comprising the steps of:
<BR><BR> (a) reacting compound of formula II with chlorobromopropane using a base and a phase transfer catalyst in the presence of a solvent to yield compound of formula III;
<BR><BR> (b) reacting the compound of formula III, obtained in step (a) with the compound of formula IV in the presence of a base and a solvent followed by reaction with an acetylating agent to yield compound of formula V; and
<BR><BR> (c) reacting the compound of formula V with hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol to prepare the hydrochloride salt of verapamil, represented by the compound of formula I.
<BR><BR> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the compound of formula V and therefore the compound of formula I is obtained with a purity greater than 99%, free of impurities constituted by a dimer.  O-desmethyl and N-desmethyl
verapamil derivatives.
<BR><BR> The process of the present invention is depicted in the following scheme:
<BR><BR> ##STR00002##
<BR><BR> In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the process employs non hazardous, environmentally friendly reagents, reduces cost, and increases purity and yield of the product. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of verapamil hydrochloride represented as a compound of formula I,
<BR><BR> ##STR00003##
<BR><BR> comprising the steps of: a) reacting compound of formula II
<BR><BR> ##STR00004## with chlorobromopropane, using a phase transfer catalyst in the presence of a base and a solvent to yield compound of formula III,
<BR><BR> ##STR00005## b) reacting the compound of formula III, obtained in step (a) with the compound of formula IV,
<BR><BR> ##STR00006## in the presence of a base and a solvent, followed by reaction with an acetylating agent to yield the compound of formula V.
<BR><BR> ##STR00007## c) reacting the compound of formula V, obtained in step (b) using hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol to prepare the corresponding hydrochloride salt represented as the compound of formula I.
<BR><BR> ##STR00008##
<BR><BR> Phenolic OH group can be protected with various protecting groups like acid chlorides and acid anhydrides.  Once the --OH group is protected, the compound polarity as well as solubility will be changed.  Among the --OH protecting groups, acetyl
group is the simplest group and acetylation can be done using acetic anhydride which is commercially available low cost material.  In Verapamil crude preparation, the organic layer, in particular the toluene layer containing Verapamil base is distilled
off and co-distilled with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).  Verapamil HCl salt is prepared by adding hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol (IPA.HCl) to the IPA solution containing Verapamil base.  It was thought that if the toluene layer is treated with acetic
anhydride so that the desmethyl impurities (for example, the O-desmethyl derivative of verapamil obtained as impurity at 0.68 relative retention time (RRT)) are acetylated, on formation of the HCl salt of verapamil, the acetylated derivatives of the
desmethyl impurities will also form the corresponding HCl salt.  Further due to variation in solubilities of the HCl salts, the HCl salt of the acetylated derivatives of desmethyl impurities will be washed out during the selective HCl salt
crystallization of verapamil.
<BR><BR> The reaction involving the formation of desmethyl impurity at 0.68 RRT is provided herein.
<BR><BR> ##STR00009##
<BR><BR> The present invention therefore relates to a process, which has the advantage of removing all the desmethyl impurities formed/carried over in the Verapamil base stage.  The structures of the possible desmethyl verapamil derivatives obtained as
impurities are as provided below.
<BR><BR> ##STR00010##
<BR><BR> Further, the structure of the dimer impurity formed is provided below.

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> Step (a): Condensation of Compound of Formula II with Chlorobromopropane
<BR><BR> In a round bottom flask, a solution of 101 g of sodium hydroxide (1.37 eq) flakes in 360 mL water was prepared and 360 g (1.0 eq) of 2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-methylethanamine (NMVA, compound of formula II) was charged at 25-28.degree.  C. 7.2
g (0.012 eq) of Tetra butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) was added followed by addition of 360 g of chlorobromopropane in 3 h at 25-28.degree.  C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25-28.degree.  C. for 2 h and again was added 5.4 g (0.009 eq) of TBAB in 3
lots, maintaining the reaction mixture for 2 h at 25-28.degree.  C. after adding each lot.  The reaction conversion was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Once the NMVA content was observed to be less than 2.5%, 880 mL of water
was added followed by 720 mL of toluene at the same temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was again extracted with 200 mL of toluene.  The combined organic layers were cooled to
10-15.degree.  C. Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (415 g in 360 mL of demineralized (DM) water) was added at 10-15.degree.  C. The reaction mixture was washed with 2.times.360 mL toluene.  720 mL of fresh toluene was added to the aqueous layer
