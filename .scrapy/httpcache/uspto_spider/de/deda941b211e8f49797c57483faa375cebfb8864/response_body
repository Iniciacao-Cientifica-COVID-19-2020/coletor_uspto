<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The invention relates generally to an aspirin formulation which may comprise additional vitamins, minerals, herbs and supplements and methods for using the same for maintaining cardiovascular health.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and many other countries.  Nutritional factors are widely recognized as playing a role in preventing, delaying the onset of and/or slowing the progression of
arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
<BR><BR> Most risk markers for cardiovascular disease have a pro-inflammatory component, which stimulates the release of a number of active molecules such as inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite from
endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, and immune cells in response to injury (reviewed by Osiecki, Altern Med Rev.  2004 March; 9(1):32 53).  Nutrients such as arginine, antioxidants (vitamins C and E, lipoic acid, glutathione), and enzyme cofactors
(vitamins B2 and B3, folate, and tetrahydrobiopterin) help to elevate nitric oxide levels and may play an important role in the management of cardiovascular disease.  Other dietary components such as DHA/EPA from fish oil, tocotrienols, vitamins B6 and
B12, and quercetin contribute further to mitigating the inflammatory process.
<BR><BR> Aspirin has a role in the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's dementia and several cancers.  Encouraging all 50 year olds to take low-dose aspirin doubles their chances of living a healthy life into their
nineties.  The widespread use of aspirin, however, is limited as many older subjects are currently unable to take aspirin because of gastrointestinal side-effects.  A review by Newton et al. (Aliment Pharmacol Ther.  2004 Jan.  1; 19(1):39 45) explores
why gastrointestinal events occur with aspirin use and how a net benefit from prophylactic aspirin might be achieved in older subjects.  It is suggested that, by understanding the age-related changes in upper gastrointestinal physiology and the
mechanisms by which aspirin leads to the risk reductions associated with its use, it may be possible to direct interventions to improve tolerability in older subjects.
<BR><BR> Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), the most widely used antiplatelet drug, is clinically effective for the prevention of vascular ischaemic events (reviewed by Mahe et al. Drugs Aging, 2003; 20(13):999 1010).  Very few primary or secondary
prevention trials address the benefit-risk ratio of aspirin in the elderly.  In secondary prevention, it is generally accepted that the beneficial effect of aspirin in the general patient population, demonstrated by randomised controlled trials, can be
extrapolated to the elderly.  Elderly patients are at relatively high risk for the development of vascular disease and might also be expected to derive substantial benefit from regular aspirin administration.  Retrospective studies in the elderly found
that the benefit provided by aspirin in older patients was similar or increased compared with younger individuals.  In primary prevention, the potential benefit of antiplatelet agents must be balanced against the risk of bleeding, which is higher in
older patients.
<BR><BR> The gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity associated with high dose aspirin has been fully demonstrated, but remains poorly elucidated at low doses i.e., less than 500 mg/day (reviewed by Sibilia et al., Presse Med.  2003 Nov.  22; 32(37 Pt 2):S17
28).  Such toxicity is relatively difficult to study because lesional and/or bleeding GI complications are not always well described in studies.  The GI risk exists, starting with the lowest doses and appears to be dose-dependent.  The lesional
complications consist mainly of erosive lesions, most often gastric, and rarely true ulcers.  Cases of bleeding appear more frequent, but generally are minor.
<BR><BR> Low-dose aspirin is an important therapeutic option in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, especially in light of its unique cost-effectiveness and widespread availability (reviewed by
Gorelick & Weisman, Stroke.  2005 August; 36(8):1801 7.  Epub 2005 Jul.  14).  In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ischemic events, the evidence supports that the benefits of aspirin treatment significantly outweigh the

<BR><BR> These and other embodiments are disclosed or are obvious from and encompassed by, the following Detailed Description. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> The invention is based, in part, on the Applicants' discovery that a combination of low dose aspirin and dietary supplements that may control cholesterol or blood pressure levels.
<BR><BR> The invention is based upon a formulation which may comprise, consist essentially of or consist of aspirin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, arginine and garlic.
<BR><BR> Aspirin includes, but is not limited to, all forms of acetylsalicylic acid including buffered aspirin, enteric coated aspirin, aspirin salts such as calcium acetylsalicylate, and mixtures of aspirin with acid acceptors any of which may be used
in the formulation of the present invention.  Advantageously, the aspirin is a low dose of aspirin.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-pyretic effects, whereas low-dose aspirin
(also an NSAID) is used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (reviewed by Laine, Rev Gastroenterol Disord.  2004; 4 Suppl 4:S33 41).  The main concern limiting use of these drugs is their gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.  GI side effects include ulcers (found
at endoscopy in 15% 30% of patients using NSAIDs regularly), complications such as upper GI bleeding (annual incidence of 1.0% 1.5%), and development of upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia (occurring in up to 60% of patients taking NSAIDs).

5,846,566; 5,811,547; 5,733,572; 5,700,410; 5,292,512; 5,023,085; 4,885,287; 4,795,641; 4,559,329; 4,327,725 and 4,256,108, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, may be used in the present invention.
<BR><BR> The term "low dose aspirin" is widely known to one of skill in the art.  Low dose aspirin may generally refer to a daily aspirin dose less than about 200 mg, less than about 175 mg, less than about 150 mg, less than about 125 mg and more
advantageously, less than about 100 mg per day.  Advantageously, a low dose of aspirin is about 90 mg, about 85 mg, about 84 mg, about 83 mg, about 82 mg and most advantageously about 81 mg.
<BR><BR> B-vitamins, i.e. folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin, may be used in the formulations of the present invention.  These B-vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism (reviewed by Strain et al., Proc Nutr Soc.  2004 November;
63(4):597 603).  Homocysteine is a S-containing amino acid and its plasma concentrations can be raised by various constitutive, genetic and lifestyle factors, by inadequate nutrient status and as a result of systemic disease and various drugs. 
Hyperhomocysteinaemia is a modest independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and stroke, but causality and the precise pathophysiological mechanism(s) of homocysteine action remain unproven.  The predominant nutritional cause of raised plasma
homocysteine in most healthy populations is folate insufficiency.  Vitamin B12 and, to a lesser extent, vitamin B6 are also effective at lowering plasma homocysteine, especially after homocysteine lowering by folic acid in those individuals presenting
with raised plasma homocysteine.  However, riboflavin supplementation appears to be effective at lowering plasma homocysteine only in those individuals homozygous for the T allele of the C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) gene.  This gene codes for the MTHFR enzyme that produces methyltetrahydrofolate, which, in turn, is a substrate for the remethylation of homocysteine by the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase.  Individuals with the MTHFR 677TT
genotype are genetically predisposed to elevated plasma homocysteine, and in most populations have a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR> The nutritional status and plasma concentrations of some group B vitamins, namely vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid, have recently emerged as inverse correlates of cardiovascular risk, and several experimental and clinical studies, these
latter mostly retrospective and case-control studies, indicate a defect of such vitamins as capable of promoting the progression of atherosclerosis (reviewed by Granieri et al., Ital Heart J Suppl.  2005 January; 6(1):1 16).  Since all these vitamins are
implicated in homocysteine metabolism, and since homocysteine has a well-recognized relationship with cardiovascular risk, the simplest hypothesis to explain the relationship of vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid on the one hand, and cardiovascular
risk on the other is that this relationship is mediated by plasma levels of homocysteine.  The most convincing literature data for the existence of a relationship with cardiovascular risk are for vitamin B6 and folic acid.  These vitamins, however, have
also a series of in vitro effects indicating a direct antiatherogenic action, and the results of several clinical studies, especially for vitamin B6, indicate an inverse relationship with cardiovascular risk at least in part independent of
homocysteinemia.  A further confirmation of these data is important to devise future intervention strategies in primary and secondary prophylaxis of atherosclerotic vascular disease.
<BR><BR> Vitamin B6 encompasses pyridoxine hydrochloride in all physiologically acceptable forms which may be used in the formulation of the present invention.  The vitamin B6 formulations as described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,953,588; 6,933,291;

<BR><BR> Any form of arginine may be used in the formulation of the present invention.  In another advantageous embodiment, the arginine may be L-arginine.  Oral treatment with L-arginine improves endothelial dysfunction in hypertensives and lowers the
blood pressure (reviewed by Bolad & Delafontaine, Curr Opin Cardiol.  2005 July; 20(4):270 4).  There is also increasing interest in agentia combining the property of upregulating NO-synthase (e.g. L-arginine) and restoring the balance between NO and
free radicals (e.g. tetrahydrobiopterin) (reviewed by Moens et al., Int J Cardiol.  2005 Apr.  20; 100(2):179 90).  One of such agents could be folic acid.  Furthermore, L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis, and the anti-oxidants ascorbate and
alpha-tocopherol, are able to increase NO synthesis and bioavailability respectively (see, e.g., Woodman, Expert Opin Pharmacother.  2001 November; 2(11):1765 75).

<BR><BR> Garlic and its preparations have been widely recognized as agents for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, thrombosis, hypertension and diabetes (reviewed by Banerjee & Maulik,
Nutr J. 2002 Nov.  19; 1:4).  Oxidative modification of DNA, proteins and lipids by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a role in aging and disease, including cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases and cancer (reviewed by Borek, J
Nutr.  2001 March; 131(3s):1010S 5S).  Extracts of fresh garlic that are aged over a prolonged period to produce aged garlic extract (AGE) contain antioxidant phytochemicals that prevent oxidant damage.  These include unique water-soluble organosulfur
compounds, lipid-soluble organosulfur components and flavonoids, notably allixin and selenium.  Long-term extraction of garlic (up to 20 mo) ages the extract, creating antioxidant properties by modifying unstable molecules with antioxidant activity, such
as allicin, and increasing stable and highly bioavailable water-soluble organosulfur compounds, such as S-allylcysteine and S-allylmercaptocysteine.  AGE exerts antioxidant action by scavenging ROS, enhancing the cellular antioxidant enzymes superoxide
dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and increasing glutathione in the cells.  AGE inhibits lipid peroxidation, reducing ischemic/reperfusion damage and inhibiting oxidative modification of LDL, thus protecting endothelial cells from the
injury by the oxidized molecules, which contributes to atherosclerosis, AGE inhibits the activation of the oxidant-induced transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, which has clinical significance in human immunodeficiency virus gene expression
and atherogenesis.  AGE protects DNA against free radical-mediated damage and mutations, inhibits multistep carcinogenesis and defends against ionizing radiation and UV-induced damage, including protection against some forms of UV-induced
immunosuppression AGE may have a role in protecting against loss of brain function in aging and possess other antiaging effects, as suggested by its ability to increase cognitive functions, memory and longevity in a senescence-accelerated mouse model. 
AGE has been shown to protect against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin, an antineoplastic agent used in cancer therapy and against liver toxicity caused by carbon tetrachloride (an industrial chemical) and acetaminophen, an analgesic.  Substantial
experimental evidence shows the ability of AGE to protect against oxidant-induced disease, acute damage from aging, radiation and chemical exposure, and long-term toxic damage.  Although additional observations are warranted in humans, compelling
evidence supports the beneficial health effects attributed to AGE, i.e., reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and aging, including the oxidant-mediated brain cell damage that is implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
<BR><BR> Any form of garlic which may be used in the formulation of the present invention.  The garlic may be a garlic extract, advantageously an aged garlic extract or an aged garlic extract powder.  Garlic has many other health benefits beyond
cholesterol: the herb also fights cancer and greatly enhances immune system function.  The garlic may be a garlic supplement, advantageously an aged garlic supplement (e.g., available from Kyolic).  In a preferred embodiment, the aged garlic extract is
Aged Garlic Extract.TM.  (bulb).
<BR><BR> The garlic formulations as described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,953,593; 6,949,264; 6,932,989; 6,930,099; 6,866,864; 6,858,398; 6,692,789; 6,689,588; 6,630,160; 6,620,440; 6,579,543; 6,555,134; 6,440,464; 6,423,742; 6,379,714; 6,326,031; 6,309,676;
6,197,309; 6,171,635; 6,156,355; 6,129,918; 6,048,846; 5,976,568; 5,976,549; 5,948,443; 5,883,086; 5,641,533 and 5,626,901, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, may be used in the present invention.
<BR><BR> In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the formulation may comprise, consist essentially of or consist of a low dose of aspirin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid or folate, L-arginine, aged garlic extract powder, or any combination
thereof.
<BR><BR> The compounds of the present invention are advantageously useful in preventing or treating cardiovascular diseases, such as, but not limited to, atherosclerotic vascular disease, hypertension, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and renal
diseases.  Advantageously, the compounds of the present invention provides a method for maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels which may comprise administering any of the above-described caplets or tablets which may comprise any one of
the above-described formulations to a patient in need of maintenance of healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  In an advantageous embodiment, the caplet or tablet may be administered once per day.
<BR><BR> Keeping cholesterol and blood pressure levels within a healthy range helps control two of the key risk factors for heart disease.  There are two main types of cholesterol in the body.  One type, named HDL for high-density lipoprotein is known as
the "good" cholesterol, while the other type, named LDL for low-density lipoprotein, is known as the "bad" cholesterol.  LDL (the "bad" type) can cause a buildup of fatty deposits, or plaque, that can clog arteries and make the heart work harder.  In
contrast, HDL (the "good" type), carries LDL away from the arteries, lowering the risk of heart disease.  High blood pressure can creep up on an individual and become a problem without the individual knowing it, which is why it is sometimes referred to
as the "silent killer." High blood pressure can develop when arteries are narrowed, making it harder for blood to flow through them.  The result places a strain on the blood vessels and is a reason why high blood pressure can lead to heart disease. 
Without being bound by theory, the formulation of the present invention may protect the heart by keeping blood flowing freely.
<BR><BR> When administered to a patient, a compound of the invention is preferably administered as component of a composition that optionally comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.  The present compositions, which comprise a compound of the
invention, are preferably administered orally.  The compositions of the invention may also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral
mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with another biologically active agent.  Administration can be systemic or local.  Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles,
microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the compounds of the invention.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, the present compositions may comprise one or more compounds of the invention.
<BR><BR> Methods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by
inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin.  The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner.  In most instances, administration will result in the release of a compound of the invention into the
bloodstream.
<BR><BR> In an advantageous embodiment, the administration is oral.
<BR><BR> In an advantageous embodiment, the composition is enteric coated to prevent dissolution in the stomach.  Advantageously, there is slow dissolution of the active substance until the tablet reaches the gastrointestinal tract.  In a preferred
embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are rapidly dispersed in the gastrointestinal tract.
<BR><BR> In a less preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, 1990.  Science 249:1527 1533; Treat et al, in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer,
Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, N.Y., pp.  353 365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp.  317 327; see generally ibid).
<BR><BR> In yet another less preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be delivered in a controlled release system (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp.  115 138 (1984)).  Other
controlled-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527 1533) may be used.  In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed.  Eng.  14:201; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507
Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl.  J. Med.  321:574).  In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla.  (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug
Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, N.Y.  (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J. Macromol.  Sci.  Rev.  Macromol.  Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann.  Neurol.  25:351; Howard et
al., 1989, J. Neurosurg.  71:105).  In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a compound of the invention, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.
<BR><BR> The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient.
<BR><BR> In a specific embodiment, the torn "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S.  Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals,
mammals, and more particularly in humans.  The term "vehicle" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered.  Such pharmaceutical vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils, including
those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like.  The pharmaceutical vehicles can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and
the like.  In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used.  When administered to a patient, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are preferably sterile.  Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of
the invention is administered intravenously.  Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions.  Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such as
starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like.  The present compositions, if
desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or buffering agents.
<BR><BR> The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablet %, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or
any other form suitable for use.  In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,698,155).  Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Mack Publishing Co.  Easton, Pa., 19th ed., 1995, pp.  1447 to 1676, incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR> Advantageously, the composition is administered in the form of a caplet or a tablet.  A tablet generally refers to a small solid pill containing a measured medicinal dose, usually intended to be taken orally.  A caplet generally refers to a
tablet of medicine taken orally.  The terms tablet and caplet may be used interchangeably.
<BR><BR> In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral administration to human beings.  Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of
tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example.  Orally administered compositions may contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or
saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry, coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation.  Moreover, where in tablet or pill form the compositions can be coated to delay
disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time.  Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally
administered compositions.  In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture.  These delivery platforms can
provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations.  A nine delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used.  Oral compositions can include standard
vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.  Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile
isotonic aqueous buffer.  Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent.
<BR><BR> The amount of a compound of the invention that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition disclosed herein will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical
techniques.  In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges.  The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and
should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances.  However, suitable dosage ranges for oral administration are generally about 0.001 milligram to about 200 milligrams of a compound of the invention or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof per kilogram body weight per day.  In specific preferred embodiments of the invention, the oral dose is about 0.01 milligram to about 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, more preferably about 0.1
milligram to about 75 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, more preferably about 0.5 milligram to 5 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day.  The dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one
compound of the invention is administered, or if a compound of the invention is administered with a therapeutic agent, then the preferred dosages correspond to the total amount administered.  Oral compositions preferably contain about 10% to about 95%
active ingredient by weight.

different composition from that comprising the compound of the invention.  In another embodiment, a composition comprising a compound of the invention is administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent.  As many of the
disorders for which the compounds of the invention are useful in treating are chronic, in one embodiment combination therapy involves alternating between administering a composition comprising a compound of the invention and a composition comprising
another therapeutic agent, e.g., to minimize the toxicity associated with a particular drug.  The duration of administration of the compound of the invention or therapeutic agent can be, e.g., one month, three months, six months, a year, or for more
extended periods.  In certain embodiments, when a compound of the invention is administered concurrently with another therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to, toxicity, the therapeutic agent can
advantageously be administered at a dose that fans below the threshold at which the adverse side is elicited.
<BR><BR> Having thus described in detail preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention defined by the above paragraphs is not to be limited to particular details set forth in the above description as many
apparent variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.
