       <p> Methods and products for treating proliferative diseases, and wounds,
     using as a pharmacon an autophagy inhibitor, a glycolytic inhibitor,
     and/or an agent able to alter cellular production of reactive oxygen, or
     combination thereof, optionally in combination with one or more
     chemotherapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the invention combines a
     4-aminoquinoline, exemplified by <B><I>chloroquine,</I></B> with a glycolytic
     inhibitor, exemplified by 2-deoxy-D-glucose and anti-VEGF antibodies. The
     systems and methods of the invention may be used to treat drug-resistant
     or multi-drug resistant cancers.

<BR><BR> The field of the invention generally relates to methods and products for treating proliferative diseases, using combinations of compounds to inhibit cellular metabolism.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Normal tissue develops, and is maintained by, processes of cell division and cell death.  In many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes mellitus Type I, and autoimmune disease, the normal balance between cell division and cell death is disrupted,
causing either a rapid growth of unwanted and potentially dangerous cells, and/or a loss of cells essential to maintaining the functions of tissue.  Inappropriate cell division or cell death can result in serious life-threatening diseases.  Diseases
associated with increased cell division include cancer and atherosclerosis.  Diseases resulting from increased cell death include AIDS, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinitis
pigmentosa), aplastic anemia, atherosclerosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, reperfusion injury), and toxin-induced liver disease.
<BR><BR> The immune system, a complex organization of cells, tissues and organs, serves to protect us from potential harm.  Extraordinary advances in our understanding of the immune system have been made in the last hundred years, especially since the
discovery of the T cell and B cell [2-4].  Native T-cells require two signals for activation.  These are recognition of antigens in Major Histocompatibility Complex-encoded (MHC) molecules [2], and a co-stimulation signal [5-9] provided by the B7/CD28
family members or other co-stimulatory molecules such as Fas (CD95) [10].  Previously activated T cells can be reactivated by co-stimulation alone [11, 12].  In the absence of activation, T-cells disregard the tissue.  If a T cell is activated the
consequences can be: 1) destruction of the damaged cells or 2) repair of damaged cells by promoting regeneration either directly or indirectly.
<BR><BR> A natural question is: why doesn't the immune system destroy tumor cells as they arise? In fact, there is substantial evidence that the immune system does play an extensive role in suppressing cancer.  For example, it is known that people on
immune-suppressive therapy have a much higher cancer rate as do people with AIDS [13] and the very young and very old.  However, it is also clear that the ability of the immune system to control cancer is not perfect.
<BR><BR> Researchers have for many years tried to stimulate the immune system as a therapeutic strategy against cancer [14, 15].  These attempts have generally been ineffective, although there have been some recent successes [16].  There are many reasons
for this variability.  These include: I) the inability to activate T cells that can destroy the tumor due to the absence of signal one (lack of recognition of the appropriate tumor antigen); 2) the presence of a signal two that results in the production
of the wrong cytokines by T cells which may lead to the growth of tumors, or 3) the failure of activated T cells to kill cancerous cells [17].
<BR><BR> Anti-cancer agents may work to promote the death of tumor cells in multiple ways.  First, these agents may work by direct cytolysis requiring active participation of the tumor cell in the death process [19].  Second, chemotherapeutics may
promote the ability of the tumor cell to be recognized by cells of the immune system and to be killed by immune-directed cell death [20].  Third, these agents may work to "rewire" the death inducing receptor/ligand pairs which include Fas and FasL [18,
19, 20].  The second and third possibilities are not mutually exclusive and may work in concert to result in tumor cell death.
<BR><BR> Several cell surface proteins have previously been identified as cell death proteins.  These proteins are believed to be involved in initiating a signal which instructs the cell to die.  Cell death proteins include, for example, Fas/CD95
(Trauth, et al., Science, 245:301, 1989), tumor necrosis factor receptors, immune cell receptors such as CD40, OX40, CD27 and 4-1BB (Smith, et al., Cell, 76:959, 1994), and RIP (U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,674,734).  These proteins are believed to be important
mediators of cell death.  These mediators, however, do not always instruct a cell to die.  In some cases, these mediators actually instruct a cell to undergo cell division.  The intracellular environment, and particularly the status of the proton motor
force and the source of fuel for mitochondrial metabolism, determines whether stimulation of the cell death protein will lead to a signal for death or cell division (see, e.g., U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 09/277,575, incorporated herein by
reference).
<BR><BR> Every year at least 6.2 million people die worldwide from cancer [1].  Many cancer patients will be treated by chemotherapy.
<BR><BR> For some people this treatment will be effective, but it many cases chemotherapy is not successful, in part because of the development of drug resistance.  It is commonly observed in treating cancers, that initial treatments, such as with
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, are effective to destroy significant numbers of tumor cells, only to leave behind a small number of tumor cells that are resistant to the treatment, which then multiply to form newly detected tumors that are
increasingly resistant to treatment as new rounds of therapy are tried.  The growing popularity of "cocktails" of chemotherapy drugs has given rise to multidrug resistant ("MDR") tumor cells, which are ever more difficult to destroy.  Drug sensitive
tumor cells, under the selective pressure of treatment with drugs, develop into drug resistant versions of the same tumor cell type.  It is the drug resistant cells that take over, and with each round of chemotherapy the proportion of drug resistant
cells to drug sensitive cells increases, to the point where recovery becomes more and more difficult, and eventually the cancer becomes untreatable.  Indeed, drug resistance, either acquired or inherent, is the leading cause of death in cancer [21]. 
Mechanisms which have been suggested to account for drug resistance include over-expression of a multi-drug resistance transporter (pgp-1) [21], failure to express death inducing receptors [21, 22], and a metabolic strategy that may provide protection
from a variety of stresses.  Because drug resistance is such an important problem, one of the goals of the present invention is to provide methods to overcome this problem.  Methods for dealing with MDR tumor cells have been proposed, but without
practical, clear clinical success at entirely eliminating such cells and providing a cure for patients with MDR tumors.
<BR><BR> Another mechanism that takes part cell death is autophagy, or autophagocytosis, a catabolic process involving the degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal machinery; see Carew et al. [23], incorporated herein by reference.  A
variety of autophagic processes exist, all having in common the degradation of intracellular components via the lysosome.  Of interest in autophagy is the role played by a drug well known in treating or protecting against malaria, namely chloroquine or
hydrochloroquin.  Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline drug having the formula:
<BR><BR> ##STR00001##
<BR><BR> Chloroquine has long been used in the treatment or prevention of malaria.  As it also mildly suppresses the immune system, it is used in some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.  Chloroquine is a
lysosomotropic agent, meaning that it accumulates preferentially in the lysosomes of cells in the body.  It also has radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties, which are beginning to be exploited in anticancer strategies in humans.  See in this
regard, the following two papers, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference: Savarino A, Lucia M B, Giordano F, Cauda R. "Risks and benefits of chloroquine use in anticancer strategies." Lancet Oncol.  2006 October; 7(10):792-3; and

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> The invention generally relates to methods and products for treating proliferative diseases, using combinations of compounds to block disease-specific cellular metabolic pathways.  It is believed that the combinations of compounds of the
invention can effectively block multiple cellular metabolic pathways, resulting in cellular apoptosis.  For instance, a drug sensitive cell is typically glycolytic, using high rate glycolysis in the cytosol of the cell and high rate glucose oxidation in
the mitochondria of the cell for energy generation.  Under some conditions drug sensitive cancer cells also use autophagy to generate energy, causing fatty acid accumulation in the lysosome and fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria.  A strategy for
killing a drug sensitive cell or causing apoptosis of the cell, according to the invention, would involve the administration of a cocktail of compounds that would block high rate glycolysis and autophagy to cause the cell to remain highly drug sensitive,
followed by a traditional anti-proliferative drug.  A drug resistant cell depends on lipid metabolism, in specific, fatty acid oxidation, such as that promoted by autophagy, and on high rate glycolysis as a source of energy.  Treating a drug resistant
cell with cocktail of compounds that would block high rate glycolysis and autophagy results in starvation of the cell followed by cell death.  Thus, a strategy for killing a drug resistant cell, according to the invention, would involve the
administration of a cocktail of compounds that would block glycolysis and autophagy, optionally, followed by a traditional anti-proliferative drug.  In some instances, it is beneficial also to block fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, which can
be achieved by a fatty acid metabolism inhibitor.
<BR><BR> Thus, the methods of the invention involve the use of a combination of an autophagy inhibitor and a glycolytic inhibitor to inhibit the proliferation of a proliferative cell.  In order to enhance the effect of inhibiting proliferation and
causing cell death the method may further include the use of a traditional anti-proliferative drug and/or a fatty acid metabolism inhibitor.
<BR><BR> As shown in the in vivo and in vitro data presented in the examples, the combination of an autophagy inhibitor, i.e. chloroquine, and a glycolytic inhibitor, i.e. bevacizumab, had potent anti-tumor effects.  The ability to block both metabolic
pathways in the tumor cells studied produced enhanced tumor cell death.  While 4-aminoquinolines such as chloroquine, have been known for treating malaria, and bevacizumab is known for treating cancer, the enhanced effect of the combination in treating
cancer is heretofore unknown and unexpected.  The cocktails of compounds described herein provide potent therapeutics in the treatment of proliferative disorders.
<BR><BR> In particular embodiments, the compositions of the invention comprise a therapeutically acceptable amount of an autophagy modulator and a glycolytic inhibitor, optionally in combination with one or more other chemotherapeutic agents.  In
preferred embodiments, the invention combines a 4-aminoquinoline as the autophagy modulator, exemplified by chloroquine, with a glycolytic inhibitor, exemplified by a 2-deoxyglucose compound, represented by 2-deoxy-D-glucose and bevacizumab.
<BR><BR> In other particular embodiments, an anti-cancer agent, such as methotrexate, trimetrexate, adriamycin, or taxotere, can also administered to the subject, preferably as part of the same treatment regimen.  Similarly, immunotherapies, such as
tumor cell vaccines, and biotherapies such as cytokine therapies, are useful for stimulating a specific immune response against a cancer antigen.  The procedure can be applied along with or after radiation treatment, and after surgically removing a tumor
from the subject.
<BR><BR> The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for treating proliferative diseases such as cancers, immunological conditions, autoimmune diseases, and wounds.  Various aspects of the invention involve the treatment of cells with
an autophagy modulator and a glycolytic inhibitor, optionally in combination with one or more agents and/or fatty acid metabolism inhibitors.  The manipulation of the cells may be performed simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.  The cells may be
manipulated under any suitable condition, i.e., in vivo, ex vivo, in vitro, etc.
<BR><BR> Autophagy Modulators
<BR><BR> According to one set of embodiments, the cells are exposed to an autophagy modulator.  An "autophagy modulator," as used herein, is a lysosomotropic agent, meaning that it accumulates preferentially in the lysosomes of cells in the body.  While
the mechanism of operation is not well understood by scientists working with autophagy modulators, it appears that such a modulator is effective both to kills cells by increasing autophagy with drug sensitive cells that do not need fatty acid
oxidation/autophagy for their metabolic strategies, and by inhibiting autophagy in cells that depend on autophagy to survive.  Again, while no one knows exactly how its lysosoma-tropic properties function, it may well inhibit the acidic hydrolases
(enzymes in the lysosomes) that are necessary to break down proteins, lipids, etc. for processing and removal) by being attracted to the lysosome and by increasing the pH to decrease the necessary acidity for the enzymes to work.
<BR><BR> The autophagy modulator is preferably an autophagy inhibitor.  An autophagy inhibitor, as used herein, is any compound which blocks the collection or metabolism of lipids in the lysosome.  In some embodiments, the autophagy inhibitor is selected
from the group consisting of: chloroquine compounds, 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A1, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), okadaic acid, autophagy-suppressive algal toxins which inhibit protein phosphatases of type 2A or type 1, analogues of
cAMP, and drugs which elevate cAMP levels, adenosine, N6-mercaptopurine riboside, wortmannin, and vinblastine.  In addition, antisense or siRNA that inhibit expression of proteins essential for autophagy, such as for example ATG5, may also be used
according to the methods of the invention.
<BR><BR> The autophagy inhibitor is preferably a chloroquine compound.  Chloroquine is a synthetically manufactured drug containing a quinoline nucleus (The Merck Index, p. 2220, 1996).  The chloroquine compounds useful according to the invention include
chloroquine analogs and derivatives.  A number of chloroquine analogs and derivatives are well known.  For example, suitable compounds include but are not limited to chloroquine, chloroquine phosphate, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine diphosphate,
chloroquine sulphate, hydroxychloroquine sulphate, or enantiomers, derivatives, analogs, metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and mixtures thereof.
<BR><BR> Examples of suitable chloroquine compounds include chloroquine phosphate; 7-chloro-4-(4-diethylamino-1-butylamino)quinoline (desmethylchloroquine); 7-hydroxy-4-(4-diethylamino-1-butylamino)quinoline;
7-chloro-4-(1-carboxy-4-diethylamino-1-butylamino)quinoline; 7-hydroxy-4-(1-carboxy-4-diethylamino-1-butylamino)quinoline; 7-chloro-4-(1-carboxy-4-diethylamino-1-methylbutylamino)quinoline;
7-hydroxy-4-(1-carboxy-4-diethylamino-1-methylbutylamino)quinoline; 7-chloro-4-(4-ethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-1-methylbutylamino)quinoline (hydroxychloroquine); 7-hydroxy-4-(4-ethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-1-methylbutylamino)quinoline; hydroxychloroquine
phosphate; 7-chloro-4-(4-ethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-1-butylamino)quinoline (desmethylhydroxychloroquine); 7-hydroxy-4-(4-ethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-1butylamino)quinoline; 7-chloro-4-(1-carboxy-4-ethyl-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino-1-butylamino)quinoli- ne;

<BR><BR> Glycolytic Inhibitor
<BR><BR> Glycolytic inhibitors, as used herein, refer to compounds that inhibit (e.g. slow down or block) the glycolytic pathway within a cell.  Glycolytic inhibitors include but are not limited to 2-deoxyglucose compounds and anti-VEGF compounds.

<BR><BR> ##STR00006##
<BR><BR> Anti-VEGF compounds, as used herein, refer to compounds that reduce VEGF signaling.  Anti-VEGF compounds are VEGF antagonists, including but not limited to anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, VEGF antisense, VEGF siRNA etc.
<BR><BR> The term "VEGF" refers to the vascular endothelial cell growth factor, as described by Leung et al. Science, 246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al. Mol. Endocrin., 5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms
thereof.  The term "VEGF" is also used to refer to known truncated forms of the polypeptide.
<BR><BR> A "VEGF antagonist" refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including its binding to one or more VEGF receptors.  VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies
and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule
inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases.
<BR><BR> An "anti-VEGF antibody" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity to prevent VEGF from interacting with VEGF receptor.  An "anti-VEGF receptor antibody" is an antibody that binds to VEGF receptor with sufficient
affinity and specificity to block VEGF signaling.  Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be used as a therapeutic agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF activity is involved.  An anti-VEGF
antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PIGF, PDGF or bFGF.  A preferred anti-VEGF antibody is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta
et al. (1997) Cancer Res.  57:4593-4599, including but not limited to the antibody known as bevacizumab (Avastin.RTM.).
<BR><BR> Bevacizumab is a major drug developed for treating cancer, including metastatic cancer, and has the trade name Avastin.RTM., by Genentech/Roche.  Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and was the first commercially available
angiogenesis inhibitor.  It stops tumor growth by preventing the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) by targeting and inhibiting the function of a natural protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that stimulates new blood vessel
formation.  The drug was first developed as a genetically engineered version of a mouse antibody that contains both human and mouse components, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments the VEGF antibody is not VEGFR-3 mAb disclosed by Imclone Systems Inc., New York, N.Y.
<BR><BR> The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, antibody
fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity, and antibody like molecules such as scFv.  A native antibody usually refers to heterotetrameric glycoproteins composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H)
chains.  Each heavy and light chain has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges.  Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains.  Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a
constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.  Particular amino acid
residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains.
<BR><BR> Numerous VEGF and VEGF receptor antibodies are available commercially for research purposes.  Certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular
antibody for its particular antigen.  However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies.  It is concentrated in three or four segments called "complementarity-determining regions" (CDRs) or "hypervariable
regions" in both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains.  The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR).  The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four or five FR regions,
largely adopting a n-sheet configuration, connected by the CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the .beta.-sheet structure.  The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs
from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., NIH Publ.  No. 91-3242, Vol. I, pages 647-669 (1991)).  The constant domains are not necessarily involved directly in binding an antibody to an
antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
<BR><BR> A hypervariable region or CDR as used herein defines a subregion within the variable region of extreme sequence variability of the antibody, which form the antigen-binding site and are the main determinants of antigen specificity.  According to
one definition, they can be residues (Kabat nomenclature) 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable region and residues (Kabat nomenclature 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2), 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable region.  Kabat et al.,
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.  Public Health Service, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.  [1991]).
<BR><BR> An "intact" antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (C.sub.L) and heavy chain constant domains, C.sub.H1, C.sub.H2 and C.sub.H3.  The constant domains may be native sequence
constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof.  Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.
<BR><BR> Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments.  Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical
Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)).  However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells.  For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries.  Alternatively,
Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab').sub.2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)).  According to another approach, F(ab').sub.2 fragments can be isolated directly from
recombinant host cell culture.
<BR><BR> "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody.  Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab').sub.2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; single-chain
antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.  Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc"
fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily.  Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab').sub.2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.
<BR><BR> "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site.  This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association.  It is in this
configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer.  Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody.  However, even a single variable
domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
<BR><BR> The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain.  Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain
CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region.  Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.  F(ab').sub.2 antibody fragments originally were
produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them.  Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
<BR><BR> The term "Fc region" is used to define the C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain which may be generated by papain digestion of an intact antibody.  The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region.  Although
the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at about position Cys226, or from about position Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of
the Fc region.  The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain, and optionally comprises a CH4 domain.  By "Fc region chain" herein is meant one of the two polypeptide chains of an Fc region.
<BR><BR> The "hinge region," and variations thereof, as used herein, includes the meaning known in the art, which is illustrated in, for example, Janeway et al., Immuno Biology: the immune system in health and disease, (Elsevier Science Ltd., NY) (4th
ed., 1999)
<BR><BR> Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes.  There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be
further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2.  The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called .alpha., .delta., .epsilon., .gamma., and .mu.,
respectively.  The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.
<BR><BR> The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (.lamda.), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.
<BR><BR> Fatty Acid Metabolism Inhibitors
<BR><BR> According to one set of embodiments, the cells are exposed to a fatty acid metabolism inhibitor.  A "fatty acid metabolism inhibitor," as used herein, is a compound able to inhibit (e.g., prevent, or at least decrease or inhibit the activity by
an order of magnitude or more) a reaction within the fatty acid metabolism pathway, such as an enzyme-catalyzed reaction within the pathway.  The inhibitor may inhibit the enzyme, e.g., by binding to the enzyme or otherwise interfering with operation of
the enzyme (for example, by blocking an active site or a docking site, altering the configuration of the enzyme, competing with an enzyme substrate for the active site of an enzyme, etc.), and/or by reacting with a coenzyme, cofactor, etc. necessary for
the enzyme to react with a substrate.  The fatty acid metabolism pathway is the pathway by which fatty acids are metabolized within a cell for energy (e.g., through the synthesis of ATP and the breakdown of fatty acids into simpler structures, such as
CO.sub.2, acyl groups, etc.).
<BR><BR> The fatty acid metabolism pathway includes several enzymatic reactions, which use various enzymes such as reductases or isomerases.  Specific examples of enzymes within the fatty acid metabolism pathway include 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase,
2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, butyryl dehydrogenase, etc, as further discussed below.  In one embodiment, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor is an inhibitor able to inhibit a beta-oxidation reaction in the fatty acid metabolism pathway.  In another
embodiment, the inhibitor is an inhibitor for a fatty acid transporter (e.g., a transporter that transports fatty acids into the cell, or from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria for metabolism).  In yet another embodiment, the inhibitor may react or
otherwise inhibit key steps within the fatty acid metabolism pathway.  In still another embodiment, the inhibitor may be an inhibitor of fatty acids as a source of energy in the mitochondria.  For example, the inhibitor may inhibit the breakdown of
intermediates such as butyryl CoA, glutaryl CoA, or isovaleryl CoA.
<BR><BR> 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is an enzyme within the fatty acid metabolism pathway that catalyzes reduction reactions involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Certain fatty acids are substrates for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases
located within the mitochondria.  In some cases, fatty acids may be transported into the mitochondria through uncoupling proteins.  The uncoupling protein may, in certain instances, increase the mitochondrial metabolism to increase the availability of
fatty acids within the mitochondria and/or increase the throughput of beta-oxidation within the mitochondria.
<BR><BR> The enzyme 2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase is an enzyme within the fatty acid metabolism pathway that catalyzes isomerization of certain fatty acids.  One step in the metabolism of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against reactive
oxygen intermediates ("ROI").  Thus, by generating substrates and antagonists for the activity of 2,4-dienyol-CoA isomerase, the metabolic production of reactive oxygen intermediates may be enhanced and/or reduced.  This, in turn, may affect certain
disease states, such as cancer.
<BR><BR> Thus, it is to be understood that, as used herein, compounds useful for inhibiting fatty acid metabolism (i.e., "fatty acid metabolism inhibitors") are also useful for altering cellular production of reactive oxygen; compounds described in
reference to fatty acid metabolism inhibition should also be understood herein to be able to alter reactive oxygen production within a cell.  For example, by altering the ability of a cell to metabolize a fatty acid, the ability of the cell to produce
reactive oxygen may also be affected, since one pathway for a cell to produce reactive oxygen intermediates is through the metabolism of fatty acids.  Alteration of the production of reactive oxygen in a cell may be associated with changes in the immune
profile of cells, i.e., how immune cells respond to the cell.  Thus, in some cases, the production of reactive oxygen can be affected by exposing a cell to, or removing a cell from, a fatty acid metabolism inhibitor.  The alteration of the production of
reactive oxygen may be useful in treating conditions such as cancers or wounds (as further discussed below), as the alteration of the immune profile of cells within the cancer site or the wound may stimulate the immune system and/or other wound-healing
processes.
<BR><BR> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fatty acid inhibitor is an oxirane carboxylic acid compound.  In accordance with a discovery of this invention, such compounds, exemplified by etomoxir, are able to alter cellular production of
reactive oxygen.  Preferred oxirane carboxylic acid compounds have the formula:

acid oxidation in liver homogenates and isolated hepatocytes from control and clofibrate-treated rats," J. Biol.  Chem. 254:4585-4595, 1979.  U.S.  Patent Application 20030036199 by Bamdad et al, entitled: "Diagnostic tumor markers, drug screening for
tumorigenesis inhibition, and compositions and methods for treatment of cancer", published Feb.  20, 2003, describes treating a subject having a cancer characterized by the aberrant expression of MUC 1, comprising administering to the subject etomoxir in
an amount effective to reduce tumor growth.  In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, subjects for whom the methods of the invention involving treatment with etomoxir are not intended are those diagnosed with diseases which already call for treatment
with etomoxir, particularly those subjects who have MUC 1-dependant tumors, nor those diagnosed with diabetes, or diseases associated with increased cholesterol and/or triglyceride concentration, or chronic heart failure (e.g., failing cardiac
hypertrophy associated with an inadequate sarcoplasmic reticulum function) calling for treatment with etomoxir.

acid, trimetazidine, ranolazine, hypoglycin, dichloroacetate, methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid, and beta-hydroxy butyrate.  Structural formulas for these inhibitors are shown in FIGS. 1A-1C.  As a another example, the inhibitor may be a non-hydrolyzable
analog of camitine.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor is a carboxylic acid.  In some cases, the carboxylic acid may have the structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00008##
<BR><BR> where R comprises an organic moiety, as further described below.  In some cases, R may include at least two nitrogen atoms, or R may include an aromatic moiety (as further described below), such as a benzene ring, a furan, etc.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor has the structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00009##
<BR><BR> where each of R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 independently comprises organic moiety.  In some instances, either or both of R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 may independently be an alkyl, such as a straight-chain alkyl, for instance, methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. In
certain cases, R.sup.2 may have at least 5 carbon atoms, at least 10 carbon atoms, or at least 15 or more carbon atoms.  For example, in one embodiment, R.sup.2 may be a tetradecyl moiety.  In other cases, R.sup.2 may include an aromatic moiety, for
example, a benzene ring.  In still other cases, R.sup.2 may have the structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00010##
<BR><BR> where R.sup.3 comprises an organic moiety and Ar.sup.1 comprises an aromatic moiety.  R.sup.3 may be a an alkyl, such as a straight-chain alkyl.  In some instances, Ar.sup.1 may be a benzene ring or a derivative thereof, i.e., having the
structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00011##
<BR><BR> wherein each of R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.6, R.sup.7, and R.sup.8 is hydrogen, a halogen, an alkyl, an alkoxy, etc.
<BR><BR> In yet another embodiment, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor has the structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00012##
<BR><BR> where each of R.sup.10, R.sup.11, R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14 R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 independently comprises hydrogen, a halogen, or an organic moiety, such as an alkyl, an alkoxy, etc. In some cases, R.sup.10 and R.sup.11 together may define an
organic moiety, such as a cyclic group.  For example, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor may have the structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00013##
<BR><BR> wherein R.sup.17 comprises an organic moiety, such as an alkyl, an alkoxy, an aromatic moiety, an amide, etc. An example, of R.sup.17 is:
<BR><BR> ##STR00014##
<BR><BR> wherein Ar.sup.2 comprises an aromatic moiety, such as a benzene ring or a benzene derivative, as previously described.
<BR><BR> In still another embodiment, the fatty acid metabolism inhibitor includes a dominant negative plasma membrane polypeptide.  The end result of the use (e.g., expression) of a dominant negative polypeptide in a cell may be a reduction in
functional enzymes present within the fatty acid metabolism pathway.  One of ordinary skill in the art can assess the potential for a dominant negative variant of a protein or enzyme, and use standard mutagenesis techniques to create one or more dominant
negative variant polypeptides.  For example, one of ordinary skill in the art can modify the sequence of an enzyme coding region by site-specific mutagenesis, scanning mutagenesis, partial gene deletion or truncation, and the like.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat. No. 5,580,723 and Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.  One of ordinary skill in the art then can test the population of mutagenized polypeptides for diminution in a selected
and/or for retention of such activity of the protein or enzyme.  Other similar methods for creating and testing dominant negative variants of a protein will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR> In another set of embodiments, the cells may be exposed to an agent that inhibits the synthesis or production of one or enzymes within the fatty acid metabolism pathway.  Exposure of the cells to the agent thus inhibits fatty acid metabolism
within the cell.  For example, in one embodiment, an antisense oligonucleotide or siRNA may be used that selectively binds to regions encoding enzymes present within the fatty acid metabolism pathway, such as 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase or 2,4-dienoyl-CoA
isomerase.  Antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides are discussed in more detail below.
<BR><BR> General Considerations
<BR><BR> One or more other of the compounds described herein may be an isolated molecule in certain cases.  An "isolated molecule," as used herein, is a molecule that is substantially pure and is free of other substances with which it is ordinarily found
in nature or in vivo systems to an extent practical and appropriate for its intended use.  In particular, the molecular species may be sufficiently pure and may be sufficiently free from other biological constituents of host cells so as to be useful in,
for example, producing pharmaceutical preparations, or for sequencing, e.g., if the molecular species is a nucleic acid, peptide, or polysaccharide.  Because an isolated molecular species of the invention may be admixed with a pharmaceutically-acceptable
carrier in a pharmaceutical preparation, and/or other physiologically-active agents, the molecular species may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation.  The molecular species is nonetheless substantially pure in that it has been
substantially separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems.  As an example, an autophagy modulator may be associated with other molecules, such as a glucolytic inhibitor and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
<BR><BR> In some aspects of the invention, the systems and methods described herein have broad utility in regulating mammalian cell growth and death in vitro, in vivo, and/or ex vivo.  For example, as further discussed below, the systems and methods of
the invention may be used in the treatment of cancers, tumors, and other conditions involving rapidly dividing cell populations that may be uncontrolled.
<BR><BR> The in vitro methods of the invention are useful for a variety of purposes.  For instance, the systems and methods of the invention may be useful for identifying drugs which have an effect, such as a preventative effect, on cellular division,
cancers, or cell death, by contacting cells manipulated by the invention to undergo cellular division or death upon exposure to putative compounds.
<BR><BR> In addition to in vitro methods, certain methods of the invention may be performed in vivo or ex vivo in a subject to manipulate one or more other cell types within a subject.  A "subject" as used herein, means a human or non-human mammal,
including but not limited to, a dog, cat, horse, cow, pig, sheep, goat, chicken, primate, rat, and mouse.  In vivo methods are well known in the art.  Thus, the invention is useful for therapeutic purposes as well as research purposes, such as testing in
animal or in vitro models of certain medical, physiological or metabolic pathways or conditions.  An "ex vivo" method, as used herein, is a method which involves isolation of a cell from a subject, manipulation of the cell outside of the body, and
reimplantation of the manipulated cell into the subject.  The ex vivo procedure may be used on autologous or heterologous cells, and is typically used on autologous cells.  In some embodiments, the ex vivo method is performed on cells that are isolated
from bodily fluids, such as peripheral blood or bone marrow; however, the cells may be isolated from any source of cells.  When returned to the subject, the manipulated cell can be programmed for cell death or division, depending on the treatment to
which it was exposed.  Ex vivo manipulation of cells has been described in several references in the art, including Engleman, Cytotechnology, 25:1, 1997; Van Schooten, et al., Molecular Medicine Today, June, 255, 1997; Steinman, Experimental Hematology,
24:849, 1996; and Gluckman, Cytokines, Cellular and Molecular Therapy, 3:187, 1997.  The ex vivo activation of cells of the invention may be performed by routine ex vivo manipulation steps known in the art.
<BR><BR> According to one aspect of the invention, the systems and methods described herein are useful in treating cancers, tumors, and other conditions involving rapidly dividing cell populations that are typically uncontrolled.  A "rapidly dividing
cell," as used herein, is a cell which is undergoing mitotic growth.  Such cells are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, tumor cells, cancer cells, lymphocytes (T cells or B cells), bacteria, and pancreatic beta (.beta.) cells. 
Rapidly dividing cells, for example, cancer cells such as drug and multi-drug resistant cancer cells, are often able to derive a majority of their metabolic energy through fatty acid metabolism, i.e., the main source of energy (ATP) for the cancer cells
comes from the oxidation of fatty acids instead of sugars such as glucose.  Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention provides an inhibitor for a reaction of the fatty acid metabolism pathway, which, in some cases, may kill the rapidly dividing cells
("cytotoxic") or at least prevent the cells from further division and/or growth.
<BR><BR> Thus, the systems and methods of the invention, in some embodiments, are useful for inducing cell death in many types of mammalian cells, for example, tumor cells.  As used herein, the term "cell death" is used to refer to either of the
processes of apoptosis or cell lysis.  In both apoptosis and cell lysis, the cell dies, but the processes occur through different mechanisms and/or different metabolic states of the cell.  Apoptosis is a process of cell death in which the cell undergoes
shrinkage and fragmentation, followed by phagocytosis of the cell fragments.  Apoptosis is well known in the art and can be assessed by any art-recognized method.  For example, apoptosis can easily be determined using flow cytometry, which is able to
distinguish between live and dead cells.
<BR><BR> In one set of embodiments, the invention includes a method of treating a subject susceptible to or exhibiting symptoms of cancer.  In some cases, the cancer is drug-resistant or multi-drug resistant.  As used herein, a "drug-resistant cancer" is
a cancer that is resistant to conventional commonly-known cancer therapies.  Examples of conventional cancer therapies include treatment of the cancer with agents such as methotrexate, trimetrexate, adriamycin, taxotere, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil,
vincristine, vinblastine, pamidronate disodium, anastrozole, exemestane, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, toremifene, letrozole, trastuzumab, megestrol, tamoxifen, paclitaxel, docetaxel, capecitabine, goserelin acetate, etc. A "multi-drug resistant cancer"
is a cancer that resists more than one type or class of cancer agents, i.e., the cancer is able to resist a first drug having a first mechanism of action, and a second drug having a second mechanism of action.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancer comprising administering to a subject in whom such treatment is desired a therapeutically effective amount of a composition cocktails of the invention.  A
composition of the invention may, for example, be used as a first, second, third or fourth line cancer treatment.  In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating a cancer (including ameliorating a symptom thereof) in a subject
refractory to one or more conventional therapies for such a cancer, said methods comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the invention.  A cancer may be determined to be refractory to a therapy
when at least some significant portion of the cancer cells are not killed or their cell division are not arrested in response to the therapy.  Such a determination can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the
effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells, using the art-accepted meanings of "refractory" in such a context.  In a specific embodiment, a cancer is refractory where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced, or has increased.
<BR><BR> Cancers that can be treated by the methods encompassed by the invention include, but are not limited to, neoplasms, malignant tumors, metastases, or any disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth such that it would be
considered cancerous.  The cancer may be a primary or metastatic cancer.  Specific cancers that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, those listed below (for a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al.,
1985, Medicine, 2d Ed., J.B.  Lippincott Co., Philadelphia).
<BR><BR> Cancers include, but are not limited to, biliary tract cancer; bladder cancer; brain cancer including glioblastomas and medulloblastomas; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer;
gastric cancer; hematological neoplasms including acute lymphocytic and myelogenous leukemia; multiple myeloma; AIDS-associated leukemias and adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma; intraepithelial neoplasms including Bowen's disease and Paget's disease; liver
cancer; lung cancer; lymphomas including Hodgkin's disease and lymphocytic lymphomas; neuroblastomas; oral cancer including squamous cell carcinoma; ovarian cancer including those arising from epithelial cells, stromal cells, germ cells and mesenchymal
cells; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; sarcomas including leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma; skin cancer including melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, basocellular cancer, and squamous cell cancer;
testicular cancer including germinal tumors such as seminoma, non-seminoma, teratomas, choriocarcinomas; stromal tumors and germ cell tumors; thyroid cancer including thyroid adenocarcinoma and medullar carcinoma; and renal cancer including
adenocarcinoma and Wilms' tumor.  Commonly encountered cancers include breast, prostate, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and brain cancer.  In some preferred embodiments of the invention, the compositions are used in the treatment of melanoma, ovarian cancer
or glioblastoma.
<BR><BR> The compositions of the invention also can be administered to prevent progression to a neoplastic or malignant state.  Such prophylactic use is indicated in conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer, in
particular, where non-neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly, dysplasia has occurred (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins and Angell, 1976, Basic Pathology, 2d Ed., W.B.  Saunders Co.,
Philadelphia, pp.  68-79.).  Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ, without significant alteration in structure or function.  Endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial
cancer.  Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell.  Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells.  A typical metaplasia involves a
somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium.  Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer, and is found mainly in the epithelia; it is the most disorderly form of non-neoplastic cell growth, involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the
architectural orientation of cells.  Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large, deeply stained nuclei, and exhibit pleomorphism.  Dysplasia characteristically occurs where there exists chronic irritation or inflammation, and is often found in the
cervix, respiratory passages, oral cavity, and gall bladder.
<BR><BR> Alternatively or in addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia, metaplasia, or dysplasia, the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype, or of a malignant phenotype, displayed in vivo
or displayed in vitro by a cell sample from a patient, can indicate the desirability of prophylactic/therapeutic administration of the composition of the invention.  Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include morphology changes, looser
substratum attachment, loss of contact inhibition, loss of anchorage dependence, protease release, increased sugar transport, decreased serum requirement, expression of fetal antigens, disappearance of the 250,000 dalton cell surface protein, etc. (see
also id., at pp.  84-90 for characteristics associated with a transformed or malignant phenotype).
<BR><BR> In a specific embodiment, leukoplakia, a benign-appearing hyperplastic or dysplastic lesion of the epithelium, or Bowen's disease, a carcinoma in situ, are pre-neoplastic lesions indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, fibrocystic disease (cystic hyperplasia, mammary dysplasia, particularly adenosis (benign epithelial hyperplasia)) is indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.  In one set of embodiments, the invention
includes a method of treating a subject susceptible to or exhibiting symptoms of cancer.  The cancer may be primary, metastatic, recurrent or multi-drug resistant, as mentioned above.  In some cases, the cancer is drug-resistant or multi-drug resistant. 
As used herein, a "drug-resistant cancer" is a cancer that is resistant to conventional commonly-known cancer therapies.  Examples of conventional cancer therapies include treatment of the cancer with agents such as methotrexate, trimetrexate,
adriamycin, taxotere, doxorubic in, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, vinblastine, pamidronate disodium, anastrozole, exemestane, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, toremifene, letrozole, trastuzumab, megestrol, tamoxifen, paclitaxel, docetaxel, capecitabine,
goserelin acetate, etc. A "multi-drug resistant cancer" is a cancer that resists more than one type or class of cancer agents, i.e., the cancer is able to resist a first drug having a first mechanism of action, and a second drug having a second mechanism
of action.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the methods of the invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other forms of cancer treatment, for example, in conjunction with an anti-cancer agent, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc. (e.g., simultaneously, or as
part of an overall treatment procedure).  The term "cancer treatment" as used herein, may include, but is not limited to, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, adjuvant therapy, vaccination, or any combination of these methods.  Parameters of cancer treatment that
may vary include, but are not limited to, dosages, timing of administration or duration or therapy; and the cancer treatment can vary in dosage, timing, or duration.  Another treatment for cancer is surgery, which can be utilized either alone or in
combination with any of the previously treatment methods.  Any agent or therapy (e.g., chemotherapies, radiation therapies, surgery, hormonal therapies, and/or biological therapies/immunotherapies) which is known to be useful, or which has been used or
is currently being used for the prevention or treatment of cancer can be used in combination with a composition of the invention in accordance with the invention described herein.  One of ordinary skill in the medical arts can determine an appropriate
treatment for a subject.

<BR><BR> The invention also encompasses administration of the compositions of the invention in combination with radiation therapy comprising the use of x-rays, gamma rays and other sources of radiation to destroy the cancer cells.  In preferred
embodiments, the radiation treatment is administered as external beam radiation or teletherapy wherein the radiation is directed from a remote source.  In other preferred embodiments, the radiation treatment is administered as internal therapy or
brachytherapy wherein a radioactive source is placed inside the body close to cancer cells or a tumor mass.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, the method for treating a subject involves administering to the subject in addition to the compounds described herein an effective amount of a nucleic acid such as a small interfering nucleic acid molecule such as
antisense, RNAi, or siRNA oligonucleotide to reduce the level of VEGF expression or the level of expression of proteins involved in autophagy and the other metabolic pathways described herein.  The nucleotide sequences of the proteins are all well known

<BR><BR> The invention features the use of small nucleic acid molecules, referred to as small interfering nucleic acid (siNA) that include, for example: microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) molecules.  An siNA of the invention can be unmodified or chemically-modified.  An siNA of the instant invention can be chemically synthesized, expressed from a vector or enzymatically synthesized as discussed herein.  The instant invention also
features various chemically-modified synthetic small interfering nucleic acid (siNA) molecules capable of modulating gene expression or activity in cells by RNA interference (RNAi).  The use of chemically-modified siNA improves various properties of
native siNA molecules through, for example, increased resistance to nuclease degradation in vivo and/or through improved cellular uptake.  Furthermore, siNA having multiple chemical modifications may retain its RNAi activity.  The siNA molecules of the
instant invention provide useful reagents and methods for a variety of therapeutic applications.
<BR><BR> Chemically synthesizing nucleic acid molecules with modifications (base, sugar and/or phosphate) that prevent their degradation by serum ribonucleases can increase their potency (see e.g., Eckstein et al., International Publication No. WO
92/07065; Perrault et al, 1990 Nature 344, 565; Pieken et al., 1991, Science 253, 314; Usman and Cedergren, 1992, Trends in Biochem.  Sci.  17, 334; Usman et al., International Publication No. WO 93/15187; and Rossi et al., International Publication No.
WO 91/03162; Sproat, U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,334,711; and Burgin et al., supra; all of these describe various chemical modifications that can be made to the base, phosphate and/or sugar moieties of the nucleic acid molecules herein).  Modifications which
enhance their efficacy in cells, and removal of bases from nucleic acid molecules to shorten oligonucleotide synthesis times and reduce chemical requirements are desired.  (All these publications are hereby incorporated by reference herein).
<BR><BR> There are several examples in the art describing sugar, base and phosphate modifications that can be introduced into nucleic acid molecules with significant enhancement in their nuclease stability and efficacy.  For example, oligonucleotides are
modified to enhance stability and/or enhance biological activity by modification with nuclease resistant groups, for example, 2' amino, 2'-C-allyl, 2'-fluoro, 2'-O-methyl, 2'-H, nucleotide base modifications (for a review see Usman and Cedergren, 1992,
TIBS.  17, 34; Usman et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Symp.  Ser.  31, 163; Burgin et al., 1996, Biochemistry, 35, 14090).  Sugar modification of nucleic acid molecules have been extensively described in the art (see Eckstein et al., International Publication
PCT No. WO 92/07065; Perrault et al. Nature, 1990, 344, 565 568; Pieken et al. Science, 1991, 253, 314317; Usman and Cedergren, Trends in Biochem.  Sci., 1992, 17, 334 339; Usman et al. International Publication PCT No. WO 93/15187; Sproat, U.S.  Pat. 
No. 5,334,711 and Beigelman et al., 1995, J. Biol.  Chem., 270, 25702; Beigelman et al., International PCT publication No. WO 97/26270; Beigelman et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,716,824; Usman et al., molecule comprises one or more chemical modifications.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, one of the strands of the double-stranded siNA molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence of a target RNA or a portion thereof, and the second strand of the double-stranded siNA
molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence identical to the nucleotide sequence or a portion thereof of the targeted RNA.  In another embodiment, one of the strands of the double-stranded siNA molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence that is substantially
complementary to a nucleotide sequence of a target RNA or a portion thereof, and the second strand of the double-stranded siNA molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence substantially similar to the nucleotide sequence or a portion thereof of the target
RNA.  In another embodiment, each strand of the siNA molecule comprises about 19 to about 23 nucleotides, and each strand comprises at least about 19 nucleotides that are complementary to the nucleotides of the other strand.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments an siNA is an shRNA, shRNA-mir, or microRNA molecule encoded by and expressed from a genomically integrated transgene or a plasmid-based expression vector.  Thus, in some embodiments a molecule capable of inhibiting mRNA
expression, or microRNA activity, is a transgene or plasmid-based expression vector that encodes a small-interfering nucleic acid.  Such transgenes and expression vectors can employ either polymerase II or polymerase III promoters to drive expression of
these shRNAs and result in functional siRNAs in cells.  The former polymerase permits the use of classic protein expression strategies, including inducible and tissue-specific expression systems.  In some embodiments, transgenes and expression vectors
are controlled by tissue specific promoters.  In other embodiments transgenes and expression vectors are controlled by inducible promoters, such as tetracycline inducible expression systems.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a small interfering nucleic acid of the invention is expressed in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector.  The recombinant mammalian expression vector may be capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid
preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid).  Tissue specific regulatory elements are known in the art.  Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the
myosin heavy chain promoter, albumin promoter, lymphoid-specific promoters, neuron specific promoters, pancreas specific promoters, and mammary gland specific promoters.  Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example the murine
hox promoters and the .alpha.-fetoprotein promoter.
<BR><BR> Other inhibitor molecules that can be used include ribozymes, peptides, DNAzymes, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), triple helix forming oligonucleotides, antibodies, and aptamers and modified form(s) thereof directed to sequences in gene(s), RNA
transcripts, or proteins.  Antisense and ribozyme suppression strategies have led to the reversal of a tumor phenotype by reducing expression of a gene product or by cleaving a mutant transcript at the site of the mutation (Carter and Lemoine Br.  J.
Cancer.  67(5):869-76, 1993; Lange et al., Leukemia.  6(11):1786-94, 1993; Valera et al., J. Biol.  Chem. 269(46):28543-6, 1994; Dosaka-Akita et al., Am.  J. Clin. Pathol.  102(5):660-4, 1994; Feng et al., Cancer Res.  55(10):2024-8, 1995; Quattrone et
al., Cancer Res.  55(1):90-5, 1995; Lewin et al., Nat.  Med.  4(8):967-71, 1998).  For example, neoplastic reversion was obtained using a ribozyme targeted to an H-Ras mutation in bladder carcinoma cells (Feng et al., Cancer Res.  55(10):2024-8, 1995). 
Ribozymes have also been proposed as a means of both inhibiting gene expression of a mutant gene and of correcting the mutant by targeted trans-splicing (Sullenger and Cech Nature 371(6498):619-22, 1994; Jones et al., Nat.  Med.  2(6):643-8, 1996). 
Ribozyme activity may be augmented by the use of, for example, non-specific nucleic acid binding proteins or facilitator oligonucleotides (Herschlag et al., Embo J. 13(12):2913-24, 1994; Jankowsky and Schwenzer Nucleic Acids Res.  24(3):423-9, 1996). 
Multitarget ribozymes (connected or shotgun) have been suggested as a means of improving efficiency of ribozymes for gene suppression (Ohkawa et al., Nucleic Acids Symp Ser.  (29):121-2, 1993).
<BR><BR> Triple helix approaches have also been investigated for sequence-specific gene suppression.  Triple helix forming oligonucleotides have been found in some cases to bind in a sequence-specific manner (Postel et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci. 
U.S.A.  88(18):8227-31, 1991; Duval-Valentin et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  U.S.A.  89(2):504-8, 1992; Hardenbol and Van Dyke Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  U.S.A.  93(7):2811-6, 1996; Porumb et al., Cancer Res.  56(3):515-22, 1996).  Similarly, peptide
nucleic acids have been shown to inhibit gene expression (Hanvey et al., Antisense Res.  Dev.  1(4):307-17, 1991; Knudsen and Nielson Nucleic Acids Res.  24(3):494-500, 1996; Taylor et al., Arch.  Surg.  132(11):1177-83, 1997).  Minor-groove binding
polyamides can bind in a sequence-specific manner to DNA targets and hence may represent useful small molecules for future suppression at the DNA level (Trauger et al., Chem. Biol.  3(5):369-77, 1996).  In addition, suppression has been obtained by
interference at the protein level using dominant negative mutant peptides and antibodies (Herskowitz Nature 329(6136):219-22, 1987; Rimsky et al., Nature 341(6241):453-6, 1989; Wright et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  U.S.A.  86(9):3199-203, 1989).  In
some cases suppression strategies have led to a reduction in RNA levels without a concomitant reduction in proteins, whereas in others, reductions in RNA have been mirrored by reductions in protein.
<BR><BR> The diverse array of suppression strategies that can be employed includes the use of DNA and/or RNA aptamers that can be selected to target, for example VEGF.  Suppression and replacement using aptamers for suppression in conjunction with a
modified replacement gene and encoded protein that is refractory or partially refractory to aptamer-based suppression could be used in the invention.
<BR><BR> In specific embodiments, an appropriate anti-cancer regimen is selected depending on the type of cancer.  For instance, a patient with ovarian cancer may be administered a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of the compositions
of the invention in combination with a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more other agents useful for ovarian cancer therapy, including but not limited to, intraperitoneal radiation therapy, such as P.sup.32 therapy, total
abdominal and pelvic radiation therapy, cisplatin, the combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere) and cisplatin or carboplatin, the combination of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, the combination of cyclophosphamide and carboplatin, the
combination of 5-FU and leucovorin, etoposide, liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine or topotecan.  In a particular embodiment, a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a composition of the invention is administered in combination with the
administration of Taxol for patients with platinum-refractory disease.  A further embodiment is the treatment of patients with refractory cancer including administration of: ifosfamide in patients with disease that is platinum-refractory,
hexamethylmelamine (HMM) as salvage chemotherapy after failure of cisplatin-based combination regimens, and tamoxifen in patients with detectable levels of cytoplasmic estrogen receptor on their tumors.
<BR><BR> Cancer therapies and their dosages, routes of administration and recommended usage are known in the art and have been described in such literature as the Physician's Desk Reference (56.sup.th ed., 2002).
<BR><BR> The invention, in still another set of embodiments, is useful for treating other diseases associated with rapidly dividing cells, such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.  Rheumatoid arthritis is associated in its early stages with the
rapid division of synoviocytes.  This process is referred to a pannus formation.  The rapidly dividing cells produce a substance that kills osteocytes leading to the hardening of the tissue.
<BR><BR> In another aspect, the systems and methods of the invention are useful for treating or preventing disorders associated with a specific antigenic immune response.  Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the methods are used to treat mammals
at risk of, or afflicted with, autoimmune disease.  Autoimmune disease is a disorder in which the host's immune response is defective and results in the production of a specific immune response against the individual's own antigens or components.  In an
autoimmune disease, an individual's own antibodies react with host tissue or in which immune effector T cells are autoreactive to endogenous self peptides and cause destruction of tissue.  It is well established that MI-IC class II alleles act as major
genetic elements in susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune diseases.  The structures recognized by T cells, the cells that cause autoimmunity, are complexes comprised of class II MHC molecules and antigenic peptides.  When the T cells react with the
host's class II MHC molecules-peptide complexes derived from a host's own gene products, autoimmune disease can result.  If these class II MHC/peptide complexes are inhibited from being formed, the autoimmune response is reduced or suppressed, and thus
is inhibited according to the invention.  The peptide-antigen of autoimmune disorders are self-antigens.  Any autoimmune disease in which class II MHC/peptide complexes play a role may be treated according to the methods of the present invention.  Such
autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, juvenile-onset diabetes (insulin-dependent), multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, Graves disease, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), celiac disease rheumatoid arthritis, and
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  The invention includes a method for determining an individuals susceptibility to developing autoimmune disease.  As used herein, "susceptibility to autoimmune disease" indicates a likelihood of at least greater than the average
of developing autoimmune disease, and in some embodiments at least about 10% greater.  Thus the invention also includes systems and methods for treating a subject having autoimmune disease to reduce associated cell death.
<BR><BR> The methods of the invention also include methods for treating a subject having autoimmune disease to reduce associated cell death, according to one set of embodiments.  One method is based on the ability to selectively remove gamma delta
(.gamma..delta.) T cells which specifically recognize MHC class II HLA-DR on the surface of a self cell.  When the gamma delta T cells recognize a tissue having significant amounts of MHC class II HLA-DR these T cells become activated and proliferate in
order to kill more of the recognized cells.  The methods of treatment are based on the concept of eliminating the activated gamma delta T cells from the body.  These cells can be removed by contacting a gamma delta T cell with an amount of a plasma
membrane targeted UCP inhibitor in an amount effective to induce gamma delta T cell death.  This selective killing of the gamma delta cells inhibits cell death associated with autoimmune disease.
<BR><BR> In another aspect, the systems and methods of the invention are useful in treating wounds in subjects.  As used herein, the term "wound" is used to describe skin wounds as well as tissue wounds.  A "skin wound" is defined herein as a break in
the continuity of skin tissue which is caused by direct injury to the skin.  Skin wounds are generally characterized by several classes including punctures, incisions, including those produced by surgical procedures, excisions, lacerations, abrasions,
atrophic skin, or necrotic wounds and burns.  The systems and methods of the invention are useful for enhancing the healing of all wounds of the skin.
<BR><BR> A "tissue wound," as used herein, is a wound to an internal organ, such as a blood vessel, intestine, colon, etc. The systems and methods of the invention are useful for enhancing the wound healing process in tissue wounds, whether they arise
naturally, or as the result of surgery.  For instance, during the repair of arteries an artery may need to be sealed and wound healing promoted as quickly as possible.  The systems and methods of the invention can speed up that process in many cases. 
The invention may also be particularly useful for the treatment of damaged tissue in the colon.  In addition to promoting wound healing of the damaged colon, in some cases, the systems and methods of the invention can provide an antimicrobial effect.
<BR><BR> The cells treated according to the present invention may be used to treat a wound, for example cells exposed to an autophagy modulator and a glycolytic inhibitor.  As an example, ex vivo cells may be attached to a bandage or other substrate, and
the substrate positioned over a wound, at least partially covering the wound.  In some cases, the bandage or other substrate may be adhered to the subject, for example, through the use of adhesives.  Suitable adhesives can be selected by those of
ordinary skill in the art; some suitable adhesives are further described below.
<BR><BR> The systems and methods of the invention may also include additional therapeutic and/or pharmacologically acceptable agents.  For instance, the compositions or methods may involve other agents for the treatment of wounds such as, for instance,
dexpanthenol, growth factors, enzymes or hormones, povidon-iodide, fatty acids, such as cetylphridinium chloride, antibiotics, and analgesics.  In some embodiments, the compositions may also include growth factors.  Growth factors include, but are not
limited to, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-binding growth factor (IGF), IGF-1, IGF-2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, cartilage
inducing factors-A and -B, osteoid-inducing factors, osteogenin and other bone growth factors, collagen growth factors, heparin-binding growth factor-1 or -2, and/or their biologically active derivatives.  The compositions may also include antiseptics in
some embodiments.
<BR><BR> Optionally, in some embodiments, a targeting mechanism can be used to target one or more other compositions of the invention to a specific cell, tumor, wound, or the like.  It is desirable in many instances to specifically target a cell type to
increase the efficiency and specificity of administration of the composition, thus avoiding the effects that can damage or destroy unrelated cells.  Thus, a delivery system which enables the delivery of such drugs specifically to target cells is
provided.  The delivery system may increase the efficacy of treatment and reduce the associated "side effects" of such treatment.
<BR><BR> Methods of targeting drugs and other compositions to target cells (such as cancer cells or cells within a wound) are well known in the art.  One method of targeting involves antibody or receptor targeting.  Receptor or antibody targeting
involves linking the compound of the invention to a ligand or an antibody which has an affinity for a receptor or cell surface molecule expressed on the desired target cell surface.  Using this approach, a composition of the invention is intended to
adhere to the target cell following formation of a ligand-receptor or antibody-cell surface antigen complex on the cell surface.  The type of receptor or antibody used to target the cell will depend on the specific cell type being targeted.  A target
molecule may be attached by a peptide or other type of bond such as a sulfhydryl or disulfide bond.  Targeting molecules are described, for instance in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,849,718, as well as many other references.
<BR><BR> In general, the targeting moiety can be coupled to a composition of the invention.  The molecules may be directly coupled to one another, such as by conjugation, or may be indirectly coupled to one another where, for example, the targeting
moiety is on the surface of a liposome and one or more other compositions of the invention are contained within the liposome.  If the molecules are linked to one another, then the targeting moiety can be covalently or noncovalently bound to the compound
of the invention in a manner that preserves the targeting specificity of the targeting moiety.  As used herein, "linked" or "linkage" means two entities are bound to one another by any physiochemical means.  It is important that the linkage be of such a
nature that it does not impair substantially the effectiveness of the compositions of the invention or the binding specificity of the targeting moiety.  Keeping these parameters in mind, any linkage known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be
employed, covalent or noncovalent.  Such means and methods of linkage are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR> Linkages according to the invention need not be direct linkage.  The compositions of the invention may be provided with functionalized groups to facilitate their linkage and/or linker groups may be interposed therebetween to facilitate their
linkage.  In some instances, the components of the present invention may be synthesized in a single process, whereby the composition is regarded as a single entity.  For example, a targeting moiety specific for a tumor cell could be synthesized together
with a VCP inhibitor and an autophagy modulator of the invention.  These and other modifications are intended to be embraced by the present invention.
<BR><BR> Specific examples of covalent bonds include those where bifunctional cross-linker molecules can be used.  The cross-linker molecules may be homobifunctional or heterobifunctional, depending upon the nature of the molecules to be conjugated. 
Homobifunctional cross-linkers have two identical reactive groups.  Heterobifunctional cross-linkers have two different reactive groups that allow sequential conjugation reaction.  Various types of commercially available cross-linkers are reactive with
one or more other of the following groups, such as primary amines, secondary amines, sulfhydriles, carboxyls, carbonyls and carbohydrates.
<BR><BR> Non-covalent methods of conjugation also may be used to join the targeting moiety and the composition in some cases.  Non-covalent conjugation may be accomplished by direct or indirect means, including hydrophobic interaction, ionic interaction,
intercalation, binding to major or minor grooves of a nucleic acid, and other affinity interactions.
<BR><BR> Covalent linkages may be noncleavable in physiological environments, or cleavable in physiological environments, such as linkers containing disulfide bonds.  Such molecules may resist degradation and/or may be subject to different intracellular
transport mechanisms.  One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to ascertain, without undue experimentation, the preferred bond for linking the targeting moiety and the compositions of the invention, based on the chemical properties of the molecules
being linked and the preferred characteristics of the bond, for a given application.
<BR><BR> For indirect linkage, the targeting moiety may be part of a particle, such as a liposome, which is targeted to a specific cell type.  The liposome, in turn, may contain the compositions of the invention.  The manufacture of liposomes containing
compositions of the invention is fully described in the literature.  Many for example, are based upon cholesteric molecules as starting ingredients and/or phospholipids.  They may be synthetically derived or isolated from natural membrane components. 
Virtually any hydrophobic substance can be used, including cholesteric molecules, phospholipids and fatty acids preferably of medium chain length (i.e., 12 to 20 carbons), for example, naturally occurring fatty acids of between 14 and 18 carbons in
length.  These molecules can be attached to one or more other compositions of the invention, for example, with the lipophilic anchor inserting into the membrane of a liposome and the compositions tethered on the surface of the liposome for targeting the
liposome to the cell.  In other cases, one or more other compositions of the invention may be present in the interior of the liposome.
<BR><BR> Each of the compositions described herein (or portions thereof) may optionally be associated with a delivery system or vector, according to one aspect of the invention.  In its broadest sense, a "vector" is any vehicle capable of facilitating:
(1) delivery of a composition to a target cell or (2) uptake of a composition by a target cell, if uptake is important.  Optionally, a "targeting ligand" (in addition to, or the same as, the plasma membrane targeting molecule) can be attached to the
vector to selectively deliver the vector to a cell which expresses on its surface the cognate receptor for the targeting ligand.  In this manner, the vector (containing one or more other compositions of the invention) can be selectively delivered to a
cell in, e.g., a tumor, a wound, etc. In general, the vectors useful in the invention are divided into two classes: colloidal dispersion systems and biological vectors.  Other example compositions that can be used to facilitate uptake by a target cell of
compositions of the invention include calcium phosphate and other chemical mediators of intracellular transport, microinjection compositions, and electroporation.
<BR><BR> Suitable vectors include plasmid vectors.  Plasmid vectors have been extensively described in the art and are well-known to those of skill in the art.  See e.g., Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.  Plasmid vectors have been found to be particularly advantageous for delivering genes to cells in vivo because of their inability to replicate within and integrate into a host genome.  These plasmids, however, having
a promoter compatible with the host cell, can express a peptide from a gene operatively encoded within the plasmid.  Some commonly used plasmids include pBR322, pUC18, pUC19, pRC/CMV, SV40, and pBlueScript.  Other plasmids are well-known to those of
ordinary skill in the art.  Additionally, plasmids may be custom designed using restriction enzymes and/or ligation reactions to remove and add specific fragments of DNA.
<BR><BR> It has also been discovered that gene carrying plasmids can be delivered to the cells in vivo using bacteria.  Modified forms of bacteria such as Salmonella can be transfected with the plasmid and can thus be used as delivery vehicles in some
cases.  The bacterial delivery vehicles can be administered to a host subject orally or by other administration means.  The bacteria in some instances can pass through the gut barrier.  High levels of expression have been established using this
methodology.
<BR><BR> Compaction agents also can be used alone, or in combination with, a vector of the invention.  A "compaction agent," as used herein, refers to an agent, such as a histone, that neutralizes the negative charges on the nucleic acid and thereby
permits compaction of the nucleic acid into a fine granule.  Compaction of the nucleic acid facilitates the uptake of the nucleic acid by the target cell.  The compaction agents can be used alone, i.e., to deliver the compositions in a form that is more
efficiently taken up by the cell or, more preferably, in combination with one or more other of the above-described vectors.
<BR><BR> In one aspect, the invention provides a method of administering any of the compositions described herein to a subject.  When administered, the compositions are applied in a therapeutically effective, pharmaceutically acceptable amount as a
pharmaceutically acceptable formulation.  As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" is given its ordinary meaning.  Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions are generally compatible with other materials of the formulation and are not
generally deleterious to the subject.  Any of the compositions of the present invention may be administered to the subject in a therapeutically effective dose.  The dose to the subject may be such that a therapeutically effective amount of one or more
other active compounds reaches the active site(s) within the subject.  A "therapeutically effective" or an "effective" dose, as used herein, means that amount necessary to delay the onset of, inhibit the progression of, halt altogether the onset or
progression of, diagnose a particular condition being treated, or otherwise achieve a medically desirable result, i.e., that amount which is capable of at least partially preventing, reversing, reducing, decreasing, ameliorating, or otherwise suppressing
the particular condition being treated.  A therapeutically effective amount can be determined on an individual basis and will be based, at least in part, on consideration of the species of mammal, the mammal's age, sex, size, and health; the composition
used, the type of delivery system used; the time of administration relative to the severity of the disease; and whether a single, multiple, or controlled-release dose regiment is employed.  A therapeutically effective amount can be determined by one of
ordinary skill in the art employing such factors and using no more than routine experimentation.
<BR><BR> The terms "treat," "treated," "treating," and the like, when used herein, refer to administration of the systems and methods of the invention to a subject, which may, for example, increase the resistance of the subject to development or further
development of cancers, to eliminate or at least control a cancer or a wound, and/or to reduce the severity of the cancer or wound.  The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are administered to subjects in effective amounts.  When administered to
a subject, effective amounts will depend on the particular condition being treated and the desired outcome.  A therapeutically effective dose may be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, for instance, employing factors such as those further
described below and using no more than routine experimentation.
<BR><BR> In administering the systems and methods of the invention to a subject, dosing amounts, dosing schedules, routes of administration, and the like may be selected so as to affect known activities of these systems and methods.  Dosage may be
adjusted appropriately to achieve desired drug levels, local or systemic, depending upon the mode of administration.  The doses may be given in one or several administrations per day.  As one example, if daily doses are required, daily doses may be from
about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 1000 mg/kg/day, and in some embodiments, from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg/day or from about 1 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day.  Parental administration, in some cases, may be from one to several orders of magnitude lower
dose per day, as compared to oral doses.  For example, the dosage of an active compound, when parentally administered, may be between about 0.1 micrograms/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day, and in some embodiments, from about 1 microgram/kg/day to about 1
mg/kg/day or from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 0.1 mg/kg/day.  In some embodiments the dosage of chloroquine compound is 0.05 to 1 mg/kg per day, 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg per day, up to about 10 mg/kg/day, more than about 0.1 mg/kg/day, more than about 1.0
mg/kg/day, less than about 50 mg/kg/day or less than about 10 mg/kg/day.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the concentration of the active compound(s) of the composition, if administered systemically, is at a dose of about 1.0 mg to about 2000 mg for an adult of 70 kg body weight, per day.  In other embodiments, the dose is about
10 mg to about 1000 mg/70 kg/day.  In yet other embodiments, the dose is about 100 mg to about 500 mg/70 kg/day.  If applied topically, the concentration may be about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg/g of ointment or other base, about 1.0 mg to about 100 mg/g of
base, or about 30 mg to about 70 mg/g of base.  The specific concentration partially depends upon the particular composition used, as some are more effective than others.  The dosage concentration of the composition actually administered is dependent, at
least in part, upon the particular disorder being treated, the final concentration of composition that is desired at the site of action, the method of administration, the efficacy of the particular composition, the longevity of the particular
composition, and the timing of administration relative to the severity of the disease.  Preferably, the dosage form is such that it does not substantially deleteriously effect the mammal.
<BR><BR> The dosage may be given in some cases at the maximum amount while avoiding or minimizing any potentially detrimental side effects within the subject.  The dosage actually administered can be dependent upon factors such as the final concentration
desired at the active site, the method of administration to the subject, the efficacy of the composition, the longevity of the composition within the subject, the mode and/or timing of administration, the effect of concurrent treatments (e.g., as in a
cocktail), etc. The dose delivered may also depend on conditions associated with the subject, and can vary from subject to subject in some cases.  For example, the age, sex, weight, size, environment, physical conditions, active site of the cancer or
wound, or current state of health of the subject may also influence the dose required and/or the concentration of the composition at the active site.  Variations in dosing may occur between different individuals or even within the same individual on
different days.  These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation.  It is preferred that a maximum dose be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical
judgment.
<BR><BR> In the event that the response of a particular subject is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or effectively higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that subject tolerance permits. 
Multiple doses per day are also contemplated, in some cases, to achieve appropriate systemic levels within the subject or within the active site of the subject.  In certain instances, dosing amounts, dosing schedules, routes of administration, and the
like may be selected as described herein, whereby therapeutically effective levels of the composition are provided.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments where cancers are being treated, a composition of the invention is administered to a subject who has a family history of cancer, or to a subject who has a genetic predisposition for cancer.  In other embodiments, the
composition is administered to a subject who has reached a particular age, or to a subject more likely to get cancer.  In yet other embodiments, the compositions is administered to subjects who exhibit symptoms of cancer (e.g., early or advanced).  In
still other embodiments, the composition may be administered to a subject as a preventive measure.  In some embodiments, the inventive composition may be administered to a subject based on demographics or epidemiological studies, or to a subject in a
particular field or career.
<BR><BR> Administration of a composition of the invention to a subject may be accomplished by any medically acceptable method which allows the composition to reach its target.  The particular mode selected will depend of course, upon factors such as
those previously described, for example, the particular composition, the severity of the state of the subject being treated, the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy, etc. As used herein, a "medically acceptable" mode of treatment is a mode able to
produce effective levels of the active compound(s) of the composition within the subject without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects.  The administration may be localized (i.e., to a particular region, physiological system, tissue, organ, or
cell type) or systemic, depending on the condition being treated.  For example, the composition may be administered orally, vaginally, rectally, buccally, pulmonary, topically, nasally, transdermally, through parenteral injection or implantation, via
surgical administration, or any other method of administration where suitable access to a target is achieved.  Examples of parenteral modalities that can be used with the invention include intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intracavity,
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, epidural, or intrathecal.  Examples of implantation modalities include any implantable or injectable drug delivery system.  Oral administration may be preferred in some embodiments because of the convenience to the subject
as well as the dosing schedule.  Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as hard or soft capsules, pills, cachettes, tablets, troches, or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the composition. 
Other oral compositions suitable for use with the invention include solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids such as a syrup, an elixir, or an emulsion.  In one set of embodiments, the composition may be used to fortify a food or a
beverage.
<BR><BR> Injections can be e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or interperitoneal.  For example, the inhibitor can be injected intravenously or intramuscularly for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or can be injected directly
into the joints for treatment of arthritic disease, or can be injected directly into the lesions for treatment of pemphigus vulgaris.  The composition can be injected interdermally for treatment or prevention of infectious disease, for example.  In some
embodiments, the injections can be given at multiple locations.  Implantation includes inserting implantable drug delivery systems, e.g., microspheres, hydrogels, polymeric reservoirs, cholesterol matrixes, polymeric systems, e.g., matrix erosion and/or
diffusion systems and non-polymeric systems, e.g., compressed, fused, or partially-fused pellets.  For systemic administration, it may be useful to encapsulate the composition in liposomes.
<BR><BR> Inhalation includes administering the composition with an aerosol in an inhaler, either alone or attached to a carrier that can be absorbed.
<BR><BR> In general, the compositions of the invention may be delivered using a bioerodible implant by way of diffusion, or more preferably, by degradation of the polymeric matrix.  Exemplary synthetic polymers which can be used to form the biodegradable
delivery system include: polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terepthalates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, poly-vinyl halides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides,
polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and copolymers thereof, alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, cellulose sulphate sodium salt, poly(methyl
methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate),
poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(vinyl alcohols), polyvinyl acetate, poly vinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
and polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-co-caprolactone), and natural polymers such as alginate and other polysaccharides including dextran and cellulose,
collagen, chemical derivatives thereof (substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art), albumin and other hydrophilic
proteins, zein and other prolamines and hydrophobic proteins, copolymers and mixtures thereof.  In general, these materials degrade either by enzymatic hydrolysis or exposure to water in vivo, by surface or bulk erosion.  Examples of non-biodegradable
polymers include ethylene vinyl acetate, poly(meth)acrylic acid, polyamides, copolymers and mixtures thereof.
<BR><BR> Bioadhesive polymers of particular interest in some cases include, but are not limited to, the bioerodible hydrogels described by Sawhney, et al., Macromolecules, 26:581-587, 1993, the teachings of which are incorporated herein, as well as
polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, polyanhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl
methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate).
<BR><BR> The systems and methods of the invention can be administered by any method which allows the composition of the invention to reach the target cells, e.g., tumor cells.  These methods include, e.g., injection, infusion, deposition, implantation,
anal or vaginal supposition, oral ingestion, inhalation, topical administration, or any other method of administration where access to the target cells by the inhibitor is obtained.  In some embodiments, topical administration is preferred, due to the
high concentration of APCs in the skin.  One method for accomplishing topical administration includes transdermal administration, such as iontophoresis.  Iontophoretic transmission can be accomplished by using commercially-available patches which deliver
a compound continuously through unbroken skin for periods of hours to days to weeks, depending on the particular patch.  This method allows for the controlled delivery of the composition through the skin in relatively high concentrations.  One example of
an iontophoretic patch is the LECTRO PATCH.TM.  sold by General Medical Company of Los Angeles, Calif.  The patch provides dosages of different concentrations which can be continuously or periodically administered across the skin using electronic
stimulation of reservoirs containing the composition.  Topical administration also includes epidermal administration which involves the mechanical or chemical irritation of the outermost layer of the epidermis sufficiently to provoke an immune response
to the irritant.  The irritant attracts APCs to the site of irritation where they can then take up the composition.  One example of a mechanical irritant is a tyne-containing device.  Such a device contains tynes which irritate the skin and deliver the
drug at the same time, for instance, the MONO VACC.TM.  manufactured by Pasteur Merieux of Lyon, France.  The device contains a syringe plunger at one end and a tyne disk at the other.  The tyne disk supports several narrow diameter tynes which are
capable of scratching the outermost layer of epidermal cells.  Chemical irritants include, for instance, keratinolytic agents, such as salicylic acid, and can be used alone or in conjunction with other irritants such as mechanical irritants.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments of the invention, the administration of the composition of the invention may be designed so as to result in sequential exposures to the composition over a certain time period, for example, hours, days, weeks, months, or
years.  This may be accomplished, for example, by repeated administration of a composition of the invention by one of the methods described above, and/or by a sustained or controlled release delivery system in which the composition is delivered over a
prolonged period, usually without repeated administrations.  Administration of the composition using such a delivery system may be, for example, by oral dosage forms, bolus injections, transdermal patches or subcutaneous implants.  Maintaining a
substantially constant concentration of the composition may be desirable in some cases.
<BR><BR> Other delivery systems suitable for use with the present invention include time-release, delayed release, sustained release, or controlled release delivery systems.  Such systems may avoid repeated administrations in many cases, increasing
convenience to the subject and the physician.  Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art.  They include, for example, polymer-based systems such as polylactic and/or polyglycolic acids,
polyanhydrides, polycaprolactones, copolyoxalates, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and/or combinations of these.  Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S.  Pat.  No.
5,075,109.  Other examples include nonpolymer systems that are lipid-based including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-, di- and triglycerides, hydrogel release systems, liposome-based systems,
phospholipid based-systems, silastic systems, peptide based systems, wax coatings, compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients, or partially fused implants.  Specific examples include, but are not limited to, erosional systems in which
the composition is contained in a form within a matrix (for example, as described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,452,775, 4,675,189, 5,736,152, 4,667,014, 4,748,034 and 5,239,660), or diffusional systems in which an active component controls the release rate
(for example, as described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,832,253, 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686).  The formulation may be present as, for example, microspheres, hydrogels, polymeric reservoirs, cholesterol matrices, or polymeric systems.  In some
embodiments, the system may allow sustained or controlled release of the composition to occur, for example, through control of the diffusion or erosion/degradation rate of the formulation containing the composition.  In addition, a pump-based hardware
delivery system may be used to deliver one or more other embodiments of the invention in some cases.
<BR><BR> Examples of systems in which release occurs in bursts includes, e.g., systems in which the composition is entrapped in liposomes which are encapsulated in a polymer matrix, the liposomes being sensitive to specific stimuli, e.g., temperature,
pH, light or a degrading enzyme and systems in which the composition is encapsulated by an ionically-coated microcapsule with a microcapsule core-degrading enzyme.  Examples of systems in which release of the inhibitor is gradual and continuous include,
e.g., erosional systems in which the composition is contained in a form within a matrix and effusional systems in which the composition permeates at a controlled rate, e.g., through a polymer.  Such sustained release systems can be e.g., in the form of
pellets, or capsules.
<BR><BR> Use of a long-term release implant may be particularly suitable in some embodiments of the invention.  "Long-term release," as used herein, means that the implant containing the composition is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutically
effective levels of the composition for at least 30 or 45 days, and preferably at least 60 or 90 days, or even longer in some cases.  Long-term release implants are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and include some of the release systems
described above.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments of the invention, a composition may include a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for example, as incorporated into a liposome, incorporated into a polymer release system, or suspended in a liquid, e.g., in a
dissolved form or a colloidal form, such as in a colloidal dispersion system.  In general, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for use in the invention are wellknown to those of ordinary skill in the art.  As used herein, a "pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier" refers to a non-toxic material that does not significantly interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active compound(s) to be administered, but is used as a formulation ingredient, for example, to stabilize or
protect the active compound(s) within the composition before use.  The term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, which may be natural or synthetic, with which one or more other active compounds of the invention are combined to facilitate
the application of the composition.  The carrier may be co-mingled or otherwise mixed with one or more other active compounds of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair
the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.  The carrier may be either soluble or insoluble, depending on the application.  Examples of well-known carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylase, natural and modified
cellulose, polyacrylamide, agarose and magnetite.  The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble.  Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers, or will be able to ascertain such, using only routine experimentation.
<BR><BR> As used herein, a "colloidal dispersion system" refers to a natural or synthetic molecule, other than those derived from bacteriological or viral sources, capable of delivering to and releasing the composition in a subject.  Colloidal dispersion
systems include macromolecular complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes.  A preferred colloidal system of the invention is a liposome.  Liposomes are
artificial membrane vessels which are useful as a delivery vector in vivo or in vitro.  It has been shown that large unilamellar vessels (LUV), which range in size from 0.2 micrometers to 4.0 micrometers can encapsulate large macromolecules within the
aqueous interior and these macromolecules can be delivered to cells in a biologically active form (Fraley, et al., Trends Biochem.  Sci., 6:77, 1981).
<BR><BR> Lipid formulations for transfection are commercially available, e.g., from QIAGEN, for example as EFFECTENE.TM.  (a non-liposomal lipid with a special DNA condensing enhancer) and SUPER-FECT.TM.  (a novel acting dendrimeric technology) as well
as Gibco BRL, for example, as LIPOFECTIN.TM.  and LIPOFECTACE.TM., which are formed of cationic lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB).  Methods for making
liposomes are well known in the art and have been described in many publications.  Some liposomes were described in a review article by Gregoriadis, Trends in Biotechnol., 3:235-241, 1985, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the vehicle is a biocompatible microparticle or implant that is suitable for implantation into the mammalian recipient.  Exemplary bioerodible implants that are useful in accordance with this method are described in PCT
International Application No. PCT/US/03307 (Publication No. WO 95/24929, entitled "Polymeric Gene Delivery System." PCT/US/0307 describes a biocompatible, preferably biodegradable polymeric matrix for containing an exogenous gene under the control of an
appropriate promoter.  The polymeric matrix is used to achieve sustained release of the exogenous gene in the subject.  In accordance with the present invention, the compositions of the invention described herein can be encapsulated or dispersed within
the biocompatible, optionally biodegradable polymeric matrix disclosed in PCT/US/03307.
<BR><BR> The polymeric matrix can be in the form of a microparticle such as a microsphere (where the composition is dispersed throughout a solid polymeric matrix) or a microcapsule (where the composition is stored in the core of a polymeric shell). 
Other forms of the polymeric matrix for containing the composition include films, coatings, gels, implants, and stents.  The size and composition of the polymeric matrix device can be selected to result in favorable release kinetics in the tissue into
which the matrix is introduced.  The size of the polymeric matrix can also be selected according to the method of delivery which is to be used, typically injection into a tissue or administration of a suspension by aerosol into the nasal and/or pulmonary
areas.  When an aerosol route is used the polymeric matrix and composition can be encompassed in a surfactant vehicle.  The polymeric matrix composition can be selected to have both favorable degradation rates and/or to be formed of a material which is
bioadhesive, e.g., to further increase the effectiveness of transfer when the matrix is administered to a nasal and/or pulmonary surface that has sustained an injury.  The matrix composition can also be selected not to degrade, but rather, to release by
diffusion over an extended period of time.  In another embodiment, the matrix is a biocompatible microsphere that is suitable for oral delivery.  Such microspheres are disclosed in Chickering, et al., Biotech.  and Bioeng., 52:96-101, 1996, and
Mathiowitz, et al., Nature, 386:410-414, 1997.
<BR><BR> Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric matrices can be used to deliver the compositions of the invention to the subject.  Such polymers may be natural or synthetic polymers.  The polymer may be selected based on the period of time
over which release is desired, generally in the order of a few hours, to a year or longer.  Typically, release over a period ranging from between a few hours and three to twelve months is desirable.  The polymer optionally is in the form of a hydrogel
that can absorb up to about 90% of its weight in water and further, optionally is cross-linked with multivalent ions or other polymers.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention may include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers with formulation ingredients such as salts, carriers, buffering agents, emulsifiers, diluents, excipients, chelating agents, fillers, drying
agents, antioxidants, antimicrobials, preservatives, binding agents, bulking agents, silicas, solubilizers, or stabilizers.  For example, if the formulation is a liquid, the carrier may be a solvent, partial solvent, or non-solvent, and may be aqueous or
organically based.  Examples of suitable formulation ingredients include diluents such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, kaolin, calcium phosphate, or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic
acid; binding agents such as starch, gelatin or acacia; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc; time-delay materials such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol distearate; suspending agents such as sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or other naturally-occurring phosphatides; thickening agents such as cetyl alcohol or beeswax;
buffering agents such as acetic acid and salts thereof, citric acid and salts thereof, boric acid and salts thereof, or phosphoric acid and salts thereof; or preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, parabens, or thimerosal.  Suitable
carrier concentrations can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, using no more than routine experimentation.  The compositions of the invention may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms such as
tablets, capsules, elixirs, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, depositories, inhalants or injectables.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable formulation ingredients, or will be able to ascertain such, using only routine
experimentation.
<BR><BR> Preparations include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions, which can be isotonic with the blood of the subject in certain embodiments.  Examples of nonaqueous solvents are polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,
vegetable oil such as olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, arachis oil, peanut oil, mineral oil, injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, or fixed oils including synthetic mono or di-glycerides.  Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous
solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media.  Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, 1,3-butandiol, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils.  Intravenous vehicles
include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like.  Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and
inert gases and the like.  In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.  For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides.  In addition, fatty acids such
as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables.  Carrier formulation suitable for oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. administrations can be found in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. 
Those of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the various parameters for preparing and formulating the compositions of the invention without resort to undue experimentation.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the present invention includes the step of forming a composition of the invention by bringing an active compound into association or contact with a suitable carrier, which may constitute one or more other accessory
ingredients.  The final composition may be prepared by any suitable technique, for example, by uniformly and intimately bringing the composition into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier or both, optionally with one or more
other formulation ingredients as previously described, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention may be present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" includes salts of the composition, prepared in combination with, for example, acids
or bases, depending on the particular compounds found within the composition and the treatment modality desired.  Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal salts, such as lithium, sodium, or potassium salts; or as alkaline earth
salts, such as beryllium, magnesium or calcium salts.  Examples of suitable bases that may be used to form salts include ammonium, or mineral bases such as sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide,
and the like.  Examples of suitable acids that may be used to form salts include inorganic or mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, hydrofluoric, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric,

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> The following examples illustrate the invention with the use of an autophagy inhibitor and a glycolytic inhibitor, bevacizumab, alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic, to induce tumor cell death.
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Tumor cells (B16.F1, NIT-1, or MCF7) were thawed from liquid nitrogen.  The tumor cells were transferred into a 15 milliliter (ml) conical tube using a sterile bulb pipette.  Using a balance, the tubes were balanced with cells and spun in the
centrifuge.  The liquid was removed using the vacuum, leaving the pellet of cells.  The cells were mixed using two mls of the RPMI.  In a 24 well plate, 1 ml of RPMI was placed in each well.  One ml of cells was placed into the first well and the second
ml was missed into the second well, then one ml was transferred from the second well into the third.  The process was repeated until one ml will remain for the last well (serial dilutions).  After two to three days the cells were confluent enough to
transfer from a well into a flask.  After around 24 hours the treatments were added to the appropriate flasks (control, chloroquine, Avastin, both).  After 48 hrs.  the cells were stained using lysotracker and propidium idodide.  The plate was run in the
flow cytometer to check the growth arrest and the amount of lysosomic activity as well as the amount of cell death.
<BR><BR> B16.F1 cells were injected into mice.  intra-dermally using a tuberculin syringe with a 27-gage needle.  Each injection site receives approximately 750,000 B16F1 cells (that are suspended in 200 microliters of PBS) into each of their sides.
<BR><BR> After the tumors were visible, four mice were treated and one mouse received no treatment.  The first mouse received chloroquine, the second mouse received Avastin.TM.  (antibody to VEGF), the third mouse received both chloroquine and
Avastin.TM., the fourth mouse was the control.
<BR><BR> Results
<BR><BR> Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, data are provided showing in vitro and in vivo results.  In vivo, the photographs in FIG. 1 shows animals that have been injected with approximately 1 million tumor cells for 10 days.  After one week, the animals
were treated daily as indicated on the photographs with no treatment, daily injections of chloroquine using 20 microliters of 0.5 M chloroquine, using 10 microliters of 1 microgram/microliter avastin, or both as indicated.  The tumors were measured
daily.  When the animals were sacrificed, the numbers of cells in the lymph nodes were counted and analyzed flow cytometrically.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 shows the percent death in vitro using the drugs in cell culture.  FIG. 4 shows the lower number of lymph node cells in the treated animals versus the number of lymph node cells in the untreated tumor bearing animals, presumably because
the lymphocytes are recruited to the tumor.  There are less cells in the nodes of the treated animals.  The tumors of the treated animals contained lymphocytes, while the untreated animal tumors had undetectable numbers of lymphocytes.  The spleens of
the treated animals were very large.
<BR><BR> The data in FIGS. 1-4 show that chloroquine and bevacizumab together are more effective than individual treatments, because the tumor sizes in vivo together are smaller.  Also the in vivo tumor rate of growth is lower with both together.
<BR><BR> Scientific Summary of the Data
<BR><BR> Chloroquine is a lysosomatropic compound that affects the organelle known as the lysosome.  The lysosome performs basic functions in the cell, including the breakdown of proteins and fatty acids for uses including fuel substrates; the lysosome
is also the site where foreign antigens that have been engulfed get broken down for presentation to T lymphocytes in the immune system.  In addition, in some cells, melanocytes in particular, melanin can be stored in lysosomes until the cell dies,
releases the melanin that is pigmented.  At that point skin cells known as keratinocytes engulf the melanosome such that when the keratinocyte dies, it becomes part of the epidermis and is colored by the melanin--hence tanning of skin.
<BR><BR> Melanoma is a skin cancer that accounts for only 4% of skin cancer, but accounts for almost all deaths from skin cancer.  Avastin is a monoclonal antibody to VEG-F (vascular epithelial growth factor) that has shown promise in clinical trials. 
The interpretation has been that avastin may help block the blood flow necessary to feed the growth of the tumor.  Melanoma and pancreatic beta cell tumor cells were treated with avastin in vitro and observed, by using cell cycle analysis, that avastin
had the effect of growth arresting the melanoma cells in G.sub.0-G.sub.1 phase.  When we treated the cells with chloroquine and avastin, the cells underwent apoptotic death.  (FIG. 3)
<BR><BR> When the drugs chloroquine and avastin are combined, the data show that the melanoma cells are induced to die by apoptosis.  (FIG. 4b) FIGS. 5-6 depict the results of the in vivo tumor measurments.
<BR><BR> The combination of chloroquine and Avastin.TM.  in vivo resulted in significantly smaller tumor size, as shown herein.  It is believed that the distress of drug treatment alerts the immune system to danger, and anti-danger immune response
(conventional T cells) diminishes the number of tumor growth-promoting cells called CD4.sup.+ T regulatory cells (Tregs).
<BR><BR>DEFINITIONS
<BR><BR> Following are several definitions which will aid in understanding of the scope of the compounds described above and in understanding the invention.  All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be understood to control over dictionary
definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "halogen," or equivalently, "halogen atom," is given its ordinary meaning as used in the field of chemistry.  The halogens include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine.  Preferably, the halogen atoms used in
the present invention include one or more of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine.  In certain embodiments of the invention, the halogen atoms found within the structure are fluorine, chlorine, and bromine; fluorine and chlorine; chlorine and bromine,
or a single type of halogen atom.
<BR><BR> As used herein, "alkyl" is given its ordinary meaning as used in the field of organic chemistry.  Alkyl (i.e., aliphatic) moieties useful for practicing the invention can contain any of a wide number of carbon atoms, for example, between and 1
and 25 carbon atoms, between 1 and 20 carbon atoms, between 1 and 15 carbon atoms, between 1 and 10 carbon atoms, or between 1 and 5 carbon atoms.  In some embodiments, the alkyl moiety will contain at least 1 carbon atom, at least 3 carbon atoms, at
least 5 carbon atoms, or at least 10 carbon atoms; in other embodiments, the alkyl moiety will have at most 10 carbon atoms, at most 5 carbon atoms, or at most 3 carbon atoms.  Typically, an alkyl moiety is a non-cyclic moiety.
<BR><BR> The carbon atoms within the alkyl moiety may be arranged in any configuration within the alkyl moiety, for example, as a straight chain (i.e., a n-alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, etc.) or a branched
chain, i.e., a chain where there is at least one carbon atom that is covalently bonded to at least three carbon atoms (e.g., a t-butyl moiety, an isoalkyl moiety such as an isopropyl moiety or an isobutyl moiety, etc.).  The alkyl moiety may contain only
single bonds, or may contain one or more double and/or triple bonds within its structure, for example, as in an alkene, an alkyne, an alkadiene, an alkadiyne, an alkenyne, etc. In some cases, the alkyl moiety contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms;
however, in other embodiments, the alkyl moiety may also contain one or more substituents, i.e., a non-carbon and non-hydrogen moiety may be present within the alkyl moiety.  For example, in certain embodiments, the alkyl moiety can include a halogen, an
alkoxy moiety (e.g., methoxy or ethoxy), an amine moiety (e.g., a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine), a carbonyl (e.g., an aldehyde and/or a ketone) or a hydroxide as a substituent.  If more than substituent is present within the alkyl moiety, then
the substituents may each be the same or different.
<BR><BR> Similarly, a "cyclic" moiety, as used herein, is given its ordinary definition as used in the field of organic chemistry, i.e., a moiety structure that contains at least one ring of atoms, and may contain more than one ring of atoms.  that is, a
cyclic structure has at least one chain of atoms that does not have a terminal end.  The chain may have, for example, three, four, five, six, or more atoms arranged to form a ring.  In some embodiments, the cyclic moiety has a maximum size of at most ten
atoms, at most eight atoms, or at most seven atoms.  In some cases, the cyclic moiety may only include carbon and hydrogen atoms; however, in other cases, the atoms within the ring may also include, besides carbon atoms, nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms,
sulfur atoms, silicon atoms, or any other atom able to covalently bond to at least two different atoms (i.e., a "heterocyclic" moiety).  If the cyclic moiety contains more than one ring, the rings may be arranged in any orientation with respect to each
other, e.g., the rings may be fused (i.e., at least two rings have more than one atom in common, for example, as in bicyclic moieties, tricyclic moieties, etc.), spiro (i.e., two rings have only one atom in common), a ring may be a substituent on another
ring, two or more rings may be connected through an alkyl moiety, etc. In some embodiments of the invention, one or more substituents may be present on the cyclic moiety.  The substituents may be any substituent, as previously described in connection
with alkyl moieties, for example, a halogen, an alkoxy, an amine, a hydroxide, or the like.  In some embodiments, the substituents may also be alkyl moieties, as previously described, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.
<BR><BR> The cyclic moiety may be a saturated cyclic moiety (i.e., a moiety not containing any double or triple bonds, such as a cyclopentyl moiety, a cyclohexyl moiety, a cycloheptyl moiety, a cyclooctyl moiety, etc.) or an unsaturated cyclic moiety
(i.e., a moiety containing at least one double or triple bond, such as a cycloalkenyl moiety, a cycloalkynyl moiety, an aromatic moiety, etc.).  An "aromatic" moiety is given its ordinary meaning as used in the art, i.e., a moiety having at least one
ring in which some electrons are delocalized in the ring.  For instance, the aromatic moiety may include a benzene moiety, a naphthalenyl moiety, an anthracenyl moiety, a pyridinyl moiety, a furanyl moiety, etc. Similarly, a "non-aromatic" structure is a
structure in which aromaticity of the cyclic moiety is not present.  For example, a non-aromatic cyclic structure may be a saturated cyclic structure, a cycloalkenyl moiety such as a cyclopentenyl moiety or a cyclohexenyl moiety, a cycloalkynyl moiety
such as a cyclooctynyl moiety or a cyclodecynyl moiety, etc.
<BR><BR> Some of the compounds described herein are commercially available compounds, are derived from commercially available compounds, or are synthesized de novo using routine chemical synthetic procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art
and/or described herein.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the systems and methods of the invention described herein may include homologs, analogs, derivatives, enantiomers and/or functionally equivalent compositions thereof of the compositions described herein, for example, as
shown in FIG. 1.  Such homologs, analogs, derivatives, enantiomers and functionally equivalent compositions thereof may be used in any of the systems and methods described herein.  "Functionally equivalent" also refers to compositions capable of
treatment of a subject that is wounded or exhibits symptoms of cancer (or other conditions described herein), a subject susceptible to or otherwise at increased risk for cancer, or a subject not exhibiting symptoms of cancer, but for whom it is desired
to decrease the risk of cancer (e.g., a vaccination or a prophylactic treatment), etc. It will be understood that one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to manipulate the conditions in a manner to prepare such homologs, analogs, derivatives,
enantiomers and functionally equivalent compositions as necessary.  Homologs, analogs, derivatives, enantiomers and/or functionally equivalent compositions that are about as effective or more effective than the parent compound are also intended for use
in the systems and methods of the invention.  The synthesis of such compositions may be accomplished through typical chemical modification methods such as those routinely practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art.
<BR><BR> The indefinite articles "a" and "an," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean "one or more other."
<BR><BR> The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in
other cases.  Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.  Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A
and/or B" can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other
elements); etc.
<BR><BR> As used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, "or" should be understood to have the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above.  For example, when separating items in a list, "or" and "and/or"
each shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items.  In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only be
interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. "one or the other but not both") when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as "only one of" or "exactly one of."
<BR><BR> As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in reference to a list of one or more other elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more other of the elements in the
list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements.  This definition also allows that elements may
optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements that the phrase "at least one" refers to, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.  Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at
least one of A and B" (or, equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements
other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at
least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
<BR><BR> It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any methods claimed herein that include more than one act, the order of the acts of the method is not necessarily limited to the order in which the acts of the
method are recited.
<BR><BR> In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as "comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean
including but not limited to.  Only the transitional phrases "consisting of" and "consisting essentially of" shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining
Procedures, Section 2111.03.
<BR><BR> While several embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and/or structures for performing the functions and/or obtaining the
results and/or one or more other of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.  More generally, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that all
parameters, dimensions, materials, and configurations described herein are meant to be exemplary and that the actual parameters, dimensions, materials, and/or configurations will depend upon the specific application or applications for which the
teachings of the present invention is/are used.  Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.  It is,
therefore, to be understood that the foregoing embodiments are presented by way of example only and that, within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described and
claimed.  The present invention is directed to each individual feature, system, article, material, kit, and/or method described herein.  In addition, any combination of two or more such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods, if
such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods are not mutually inconsistent, is included within the scope of the present invention.
