<BR><BR> Abiotic stress factors such as drought, salinity, and heat represent key elements limiting agricultural productivity worldwide.  Close examination of plant-to-plant communication in nature has revealed the development of unique strategies from
plants for responding to abiotic stress, with one of the most interesting being through priming for improved defense responses.  The process of priming involves prior exposure to a biotic or abiotic stress factor making a plant more resistant to future
exposure.  Priming can also be achieved by applying natural or synthetic compounds which act as signaling transducers, `activating` the plant's defense system.  Although the phenomenon has been known for many years, it has only recently been suggested
that priming can enhance the resistance of crops to environmental stresses in the field.
<BR><BR> There is a need for new priming agents that work better to prepare plants for exposure to abiotic stress factors.
<BR><BR> There is also a need for new cost-effective means of promoting plant growth from the time of seeding throughout the maturity of a plant.

<BR><BR> As used herein, "a NO-releasing moiety" refers to a moiety that can be cleaved from a parent compound to generate NO under physiological conditions after the parent compound is administered to a patient.  Examples of suitable NO-releasing
moieties include --NO, --C(O)--(CH.sub.2).sub.n--ONO.sub.2, --O--(CH.sub.2).sub.n--ONO.sub.2, --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--ONO.sub.2, --C(O)--CH.sub.2--C(CH.sub.3).sub.2--SNO, --NH--CH.sub.2--C(CH.sub.3).sub.2--SNO, --CH.sub.2--C(CH.sub.3).sub.2--SNO,
<BR><BR> ##STR00034## ##STR00035## in which n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; R.sub.a is H, C.sub.1-C.sub.10 alkyl, aryl, S(O).sub.2-aryl, CN, or CON(R.sub.b).sub.2; and each R.sub.b, independently, is H or C.sub.1-C.sub.10 alkyl.
<BR><BR> The term "alkyl" refers to a saturated, linear or branched hydrocarbon moiety, such as --CH.sub.3 or --CH(CH.sub.3).sub.2.  The term "aryl" refers to a hydrocarbon moiety having one or more aromatic rings.  Examples of aryl moieties include
phenyl (Ph), naphthyl, pyrenyl, anthryl, and phenanthryl.  Alkyl and aryl mentioned herein include both substituted and unsubstituted moieties, unless specified otherwise.  Possible substituents on aryl include, but are not limited to, C.sub.1-C.sub.10
alkyl, C.sub.2-C.sub.10 alkenyl, C.sub.2-C.sub.10 alkynyl, C.sub.3-C.sub.20 cycloalkyl, C.sub.3-C.sub.20 cycloalkenyl, C.sub.1-C.sub.20 heterocycloalkyl, C.sub.1-C.sub.20 heterocycloalkenyl, C.sub.1-C.sub.10 alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl,

<BR><BR> As used herein, "a H.sub.2S-releasing moiety" refers to a moiety that can be cleaved from a parent compound to generate H.sub.2S under physiological conditions after the parent compound is administered to a patient.  Examples of suitable
H.sub.2S-releasing moieties include:
<BR><BR> ##STR00036## ##STR00037##
<BR><BR> In another embodiment of the invention, the compound may be NOSH, an NO-releasing moiety and an H.sub.2S-releasing moiety without an NSAID-derived core.  The structure of NOSH is shown below:
<BR><BR> ##STR00038##
<BR><BR> The compounds of the invention may be synthesized by known methods in the art.  For example, see International Patent Publication No. WO 2013/025790, which discusses synthesis of the compounds.
<BR><BR> The compounds can be administered to the plants by any known method in the art.  For example, the compounds may be dissolved in water and the solution may be sprayed on the plants or poured onto the soil covering the roots of the plants.  The
solution may also be added to an irrigation system.
<BR><BR> An appropriate dosage of compound can be readily determined by a person having skill in the art.  Dosage may vary depending upon the species of plant, the size of the plant, and the general health of the plant.  For example, the minimum dosage
per plant per day may be about 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg.  The maximum dosage per plant per day may be about 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, or 600 mg per plant per day.  A single dosage may be dissolved in 1 or more gallons of water and administered to the plant.
<BR><BR> Alternatively, the dosage may be dissolved in a solvent and administered to the plant by foliar spraying.  Foliar spraying involves feeding the plant by applying the composition and dosage directly to the leaves of the plant.  The choice of
solvent and dosage can be determined by a person having skill in the art.  Water and methanol are preferred solvents.  Certain solvents must be avoided because they cause toxicity in some plants.
<BR><BR> Any dosage can be used that does not adversely affect the plant.  Dosages can easily be determined by trial and error as each type of plant may have different needs.  For example, a minimum dosage may be about 10 .mu.M, 20 .mu.M, 30 .mu.M, or 50
.mu.M.  Likewise, for example, the maximum dosage may be about 150 .mu.M, 200 .mu.M, or 300 .mu.M.  A preferred dosage may be about 100 .mu.M.
<BR><BR> Cellular damage in leaves can be measured by determining lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde [MDA] content) and hydrogen peroxide (H.sub.2O.sub.2) levels.  Lipid peroxidation is a widely used stress indicator of plant membranes.  For example,
the method described by Heath and Packer is the basic protocol used or adapted in numerous studies dealing with lipid peroxidation.  See Heath R L, Packer L. 1968, Photoperoxidation in isolated chloroplasts.  I. Kinetics and stoichiometry of fatty acid
peroxidation.  Archives in Biochemistry and Biophysics 125, 189-198.  Measuring hydrogen peroxide levels is also well known in the art.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of priming a plant against abiotic stress factors comprising treating the plant with a composition comprising a compound containing an NO-releasing moiety and an H.sub.2S-releasing moiety
covalently bonded to an aspirin derived core or NOSH, as described above.  Priming the plant includes administering the compound to a plant so it may better withstand abiotic stress factors such as drought, salinity, and heat.
<BR><BR> In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of promoting plant growth comprising treating the plant with a composition comprising a compound containing an NO-releasing moiety and an H.sub.2S-releasing moiety covalently bonded to
an aspirin derived core or NOSH, as described above.  Promoting plant growth may involve greener leaves, healthier leaves, bigger leaves, more leaves, overall increased weight, and/or faster growth compared to control plants.
<BR><BR> The plant may be treated by any method known in the art.  For example, treatment of the plant may begin at the seedling stage where the seeds may be coated with a composition containing the compound.  Compositions may be formulated so that the
compound is released slowly to the seed throughout the germination process.  The plant may also be treated after germination of the seed by traditional methods by which plant food and fertilizers are administered such as by foliar spraying or by
administration of the compound directly to the soil or during watering.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR> The present study shows the ameliorative effect of NOSH-aspirin application on Medicago truncatula plants subjected to drought stress conditions, whereby cellular damage was significantly lowered, as was hydrogen peroxide content, after
application of the priming agent, thus highlighting a novel function-use for this compound.
<BR><BR> Plant Material and Stress Conditions
<BR><BR> Mature (40 d) Medicago truncatula ecotype Jemalong A17 plants were used for the purposes of this study.  These were grown in soil medium under controlled, optimal growth conditions and were then subjected to drought stress.  Drought was imposed
by withholding watering for 9 d (for detailed growth and stress conditions see Filippou et al., 2011).  Both NOSH and NOSH-aspirin were applied at 100 .mu.M concentration by foliar spraying at the start of stress imposition.  The hybrid donors were
diluted in 70% (v/v) and 30% (v/v) methanol, 20% (v/v) acetone or 20% (v/v) DMSO.  Cellular damage was evaluated by lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS content) and hydrogen peroxide (H.sub.2O.sub.2) content as previously described (Filippou et al., 2011;
Tanou et al., 2012), while osmoprotective capacity was evaluated by proline content (ninhydrin assay) as previously described (Antoniou et al., 2013).  Real-time RT-PCR gene expression analysis was carried out using a Biorad IQ5 thermocycler as
previously described (Filippou et al., 2013b).  Relative quantification of gene expression and statistical analysis of all qRT-PCR data (pairwise fixed reallocation randomization test) were performed using the REST software according to Pfaffl et al.
(2002).  The actin 11 gene was used as a housekeeping reference gene.  All analyses were carried out using three independent biological pools of samples as replicates (with a minimum of three independent plants per pooled sample).
<BR><BR> Results and Discussion
<BR><BR> Cellular Damage
<BR><BR> An examination of cellular damage levels was performed by means of spectrophotometric determination of lipid peroxidation.  Significant membrane damage was observed under drought conditions; however, MDA content was lowered following NOSH and
NOSH-aspirin (NOSH-A) pre-treatment diluted in 70% (v/v) MetOH, with NOSH-aspirin providing statistically significant protection in comparison with control samples (FIG. 1).
<BR><BR> The experiment was repeated using 30% (v/v) MetOH as a solvent, where the protective effect of NOSH-A pre-treatment was observed once more, with primed plants showing significantly lower lipid peroxidation levels compared with drought-stressed,
control samples (FIG. 2).
<BR><BR> Further attempts were made to examine the efficiency of other solvents for NOSH-A; these included 20% DMSO and 20% acetone.  However, treatment with the solvent itself resulted in toxicity symptoms (extensive chlorosis; see FIG. 3) although
protection in
<BR><BR> NOSH-A pre-treated plants was still evident from lower lipid peroxidation levels; therefore, these solvents were avoided for further studies and MetOH was chosen as an optimal solvent for the donor.
<BR><BR> Reactive Oxygen Species Content
<BR><BR> Abiotic stress conditions are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic for the cells.  During such conditions, the production of ROS exceeds the capacity of the antioxidative systems to remove them,
causing oxidative stress.  Quantification of H.sub.2O.sub.2 (major ROS) content revealed a massive induction in drought-stressed plants, which was significantly reversed in NOSH-aspirin (dissolved in 70% (v/v) MetOH) pre-treated plants compared with
control samples (FIG. 4).
<BR><BR> Similarly, NOSH-A pre-treated plants prior to drought stress imposition showed significantly lower H.sub.2O.sub.2 levels compared with drought-stress samples when using 30% (v/v) MetOH (FIG. 5).
<BR><BR> In addition, proline content was evaluated as proline is a major osmoprotective molecule involved in the defense response of plants to abiotic stress conditions (Filippou et al., 2013b).  Results showed that pre-treatment of plants with NOSH-A
(dissolved in 30% (v/v) MetOH) prior to drought stress imposition resulted in increased proline content compared with drought-stressed alone samples (FIG. 6).
<BR><BR> Finally, qRT-PCR gene expression analysis was carried out for key defense-related genes, including major enzymatic antioxidants (CAT, Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD, cAPX), as well as genes involved in proline biosynthesis (P5CS, P5CR).  Interestingly, NOSH-A
pre-treated plants demonstrated significant transcriptional regulation for most of the genes examined, with FeSOD, P5CS and P5CR showing significant induction in pre-treated and subsequently stressed plants compared with stressed alone plants, while cAPX
showed significant suppression (FIG. 7).  The induction in the proline biosynthetic enzyme gene expression levels comes in support of the observed increased proline content, while the induction in FeSOD transcripts is in agreement with a recent report by
Fotopoulos et al. (2014), who demonstrated that treatment with 100 .mu.M of NO donor sodium nitroprusside results in significant induction of FeSOD in mature Medicago truncatula plants.
<BR><BR> The current findings show NOSH-aspirin's capacity to provide significant protection in Medicago truncatula plants against drought stress conditions, which result in major cellular damage in controls plants.

<BR><BR> where cPTIO represents a NO inhibitor, while HXL is a H.sub.2S inhibitor.  In addition to the previous setup of sampling control and drought-stressed samples, plants were re-watered at 6 d after drought stress imposition and additional sampling
was carried out 1 d after rewatering to examine recovery of plants, while a second wave of drought stress was imposed to see if primed plants develop a longer-term, `memory` effect.  Plant Material and Stress Conditions
<BR><BR> Mature (42 d) Medicago sativa plants were used for the purposes of this study.  These were grown in soil medium under controlled, optimal growth conditions and were then subjected to drought stress.  Drought was imposed by withholding watering
until drought symptoms (loss of turgour, wilting, chlorosis) were observed (6 d after stress imposition).  Samples were then re-watered to observe recovery potential after 1 day (7 d).  Both NOSH and NOSH-aspirin were applied at 100 .mu.M concentration
by foliar spraying at the start of stress imposition.  The hybrid donors were diluted in 30% (v/v) methanol.  Physiological parameters (stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence) were measured with a DT-Porometer AP4 (Delta-TDevices, Cambridge,
UK) and an OptiSci OS-30p chlorophyll fluorometer (Opti-Sciences, Hudson, N.H., USA) respectively (Filippou et al., 2013).  Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of leaves represents the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII).  Cellular
damage was evaluated by lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS content), nitric oxide (NO) content (nitrosative stress) and hydrogen peroxide (H.sub.2O.sub.2) content (oxidative stress) as previously described (Filippou et al., 2011; Tanou et al., 2012), while
osmoprotective capacity was evaluated by proline content (ninhydrin assay) as previously described (Antoniou et al., 2013).  Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) were measured as previously described (Filippou et al., 2014).  Real-time RT-PCR gene
expression analysis was carried out using a Biorad IQ5 thermocycler as previously described (Filippou et al., 2013).  Relative quantification of gene expression and statistical analysis of all qRT-PCR data (pairwise fixed reallocation randomization test)
were performed using the REST software according to Pfaffl et al. (2002).  The actin 11 gene was used as a housekeeping reference gene.  All analyses were carried out using three independent biological pools of samples as replicates (with a minimum of
fifteen independent plants per pooled sample).  The experimental setup is shown schematically in FIG. 8.
<BR><BR> Results and Discussion
<BR><BR> Phenotypes
<BR><BR> Macroscopic (phenotypic) observation of plants showed that NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated plants that were subsequently drought-stressed had significantly improved vitality, turgor and greening in comparison with drought-stressed plants which
demonstrated extensive chlorosis and loss of turgor indicative of stress-related damage at 6 d after stress imposition (FIG. 9).
<BR><BR> Rewatering for 1 d revealed that NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated samples had notably improved recovery capacity compared with drought-stressed alone samples, as pretreated plants retained turgor and greening while stressed-alone plants showed
extensive chlorosis and initial signs of necrosis (FIG. 10).
<BR><BR> Interestingly, plants were left to grow following rewatering for another 6 days without any further watering on the basis of a second `wave` of drought stress.  Phenotypic observations revealed that NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated plants maintained
growth and vitality, while drought-stressed alone plants showed extensive levels of tissue necrosis (FIG. 11).
<BR><BR> Physiological Measurements
<BR><BR> Measurements of physiological parameters indicative of the physiological state of the plant indicated that drought-stressed plants had significantly lower (stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence) levels compared with watered plants
indicative of a stressed state, while NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated and subsequently stressed plants had ameliorated (significantly higher) stomatal conductance and chlorophyll levels compared with drought-stressed samples (FIG. 12).
<BR><BR> Cellular Damage
<BR><BR> An examination of cellular damage levels was performed by means of spectrophotometric determination of lipid peroxidation.  Significant membrane damage was observed under drought conditions; however, MDA content was lowered following NOSH and
NOSH-aspirin pretreatment, with both NOSH and NOSH-aspirin providing statistically significant protection in comparison with drought-stressed samples (FIG. 13).  In addition, rewatering could not ameliorate cellular damage in drought-stressed samples
(showing further increase in MDA content at 7 d), whereas NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated samples maintained low MDA content levels close to those of control, watered samples (FIG. 13).
<BR><BR> Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Content
<BR><BR> Abiotic stress conditions are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen (RNS) species content, which are toxic for the cells.  During such conditions, the production of ROS and RNS exceeds the capacity of
the antioxidative defense systems to remove them, causing nitro-oxidative stress.  Quantification of H.sub.2O.sub.2 (major ROS) and nitric oxide (NO; major RNS) content revealed a massive induction in drought-stressed plants, which was significantly
reversed in NOSH and NOSH-aspirin pretreated plants compared with drought-stressed samples (FIG. 14A, B).  Interestingly, H.sub.2O.sub.2 content was ameliorated even further in NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated plants following rewatering at 7 d compared with
respective pretreated, drought-stressed samples at 6 d (FIG. 14A), indicating an improved capacity to recover which also correlates with increased CAT enzymatic activity following rewatering in these samples compared with drought-stressed alone samples
(FIG. 16B).
<BR><BR> Proline Content
<BR><BR> In addition, proline content was evaluated as proline is a major osmoprotective molecule involved in the defense response of plants to abiotic stress conditions (Filippou et al., 2013).  Results showed drought stress imposition leads to massive
proline induction as expected (Filippou et al, 2014), while pretreatment of plants with NOSH and NOSH-A prior to drought stress imposition resulted in significantly lower proline content compared with drought-stressed alone samples (FIG. 15).
<BR><BR> Antioxidant Enzymes
<BR><BR> The enzymatic activity of two key antioxidants (SOD and CAT) were evaluated.  SOD dismutates superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide, while CAT directly scavenges hydrogen peroxide.  Both enzymes appear to be regulated in response to stress and
priming agent pretreatment in a differential manner (FIG. 16).  More specifically, activity of both SOD and CAT is significantly induced in 6 d drought-stressed plants compared with control, watered plants, likely in an attempt to tackle the oxidative
burst resulting from stress imposition, whereas NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated and subsequently stressed plants show similar SOD and CAT activity levels to control, watered plants.  Interestingly, rewatering results in a reversal of trends, where SOD and CAT
activity is significantly induced in primed and stressed plants compared with stressed-alone plants, suggesting an improved capacity to recover which also correlates with further lowered H.sub.2O.sub.2 levels (FIG. 14).  In any case, it should be noted
that the cellular enzymatic antioxidant battery linked with ROS scavenging is very complex involving several other components (e.g. APX), isoforms in several compartments (e.g. peroxisomes, chloroplasts, mitochondria), as well as non-enzymatic
antioxidants (e.g. ascorbic acid, tocopherols and glutathione).
<BR><BR> Gene Expression Analysis
<BR><BR> Finally, qRT-PCR gene expression analysis was carried out (FIG. 17) for key defense-related genes, including major enzymatic antioxidants (GST17, Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD, cAPX) linked with ROS scavenging, as well as genes involved in NO biosynthesis
(NR).  In addition, an aquaporin (PIP) was also examined which is linked with response to water deficit and transport.  Interestingly, NOSH and NOSH-A pretreated and subsequently stressed plants compared with stressed alone plants demonstrated
significant transcriptional regulation (induction) for SOD isoforms (FIG. 17) which are linked with dismutation of superoxide radicals to H.sub.2O.sub.2, in agreement with a recent report by Fotopoulos et al. (2014), who demonstrated that treatment with
100 .mu.M of NO donor sodium nitroprusside results in significant induction of FeSOD in mature Medicago truncatula plants.  In addition, it should be noted that rewatering resulted in general suppression of most genes examined in NOSH/NOSH-A pretreated
and subsequently stressed plants compared with drought-stressed alone plants, suggesting that the plants are in a better position to recover without the further transcriptional activation of defense-related genes which is energy consuming for the plant.
<BR><BR> Conclusions
<BR><BR> The current findings show NOSH and NOSH-aspirin's capacity to provide significant protection in Medicago sativa plants against drought stress conditions, which result in major cellular damage and nitro-oxidative stress in control plants.
<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR> An in vitro experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the potential of NOSH and NOSH-A for growth promotion in terms of leaf area increase in Arabidopsis thaliana plants.
<BR><BR> Experimental setup
<BR><BR> Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were used for the purposes of this study.  Seeds were placed on MS agar plates containing 10 .mu.M or 100 .mu.M NOSH or NOSH-A (diluted in 20% (v/v) acetone) which were then incubated in the dark at 4.degree. 
C. for 4 days for stratification purposes.  Appropriate control plates were also prepared.  The plates were then placed in a growth chamber and leaves were sampled at 23 DAS (days after sowing).  Complete leaf series were examined from seven individual
plants per treatment (n=7).  A complete leaf series consists of all leaves from each individual plant, starting from the cotyledons and including all true leaves, harvested and examined in order of presence on the plant (from older to younger true leaf). These leaves are excised and placed on agar plates where photographs are taken and leaf areas are calculated using ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
<BR><BR> Results and Discussion
<BR><BR> FIGS. 18-21 are the plates of all examined leaf series.  Acetone controls are used in order to examine the effect of the organic solvent itself on the growth of plants.
<BR><BR> An interesting observation is that the specific NOSH-treated plants displayed increased greening, suggesting higher levels of photosynthetic pigments.
<BR><BR> ImageJ leaf area analysis was carried out for control plants and plants treated with 10 .mu.M NOSH or NOSH-A as macroscopic analysis revealed visible growth induction in this case, contrarily to plants treated with 100 .mu.M NOSH or NOSH-A. See
FIG. 22.
<BR><BR> Results show that there is significantly higher true leaf 4 and 5 area in plants treated with 10 .mu.M NOSH compared with control samples, while no significant increase was observed in NOSH-A treated plants.  Interestingly, the overall rosette
area (total leaf area per plant) is significantly increased by 37% in NOSH-treated plants compared with control plants.
<BR><BR> Conclusions
<BR><BR> The current findings suggest that 10 .mu.M NOSH application results in significant induction in growth in terms of leaf area in in vitro grown plants.
