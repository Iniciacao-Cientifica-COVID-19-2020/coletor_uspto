<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention provides a composition, comprising: aspirin, magnesium, and nattokinase, and either niacin or nitroglycerine, said composition having a structural form that is suitable for being introduced into a body of a person.
<BR><BR> The present invention advantageously provides a composition for mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring pernicious thrombotic event, such as a heart attack or stroke, in a person. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR> FIGS. 1 4 depict structural forms of a composition, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> If a person experiences symptoms of an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack, the person needs medical intervention by medical professionals as soon as possible.  Accordingly, the present invention provides a therapeutic composition
suitable for being introduced into the body (e.g., by means of a body cavity) of a person.  This composition is adapted to provide therapeutic benefits to the person during the critical period prior to the arrival or availability of said medical
intervention.  The therapeutic benefits mitigate the damage that could potentially be done to the individual's coronary system prior to said medical intervention
<BR><BR> The composition of the present invention includes aspirin, magnesium, and nattokinase, and niacin or nitroglycerine.  The composition may include one or more additional ingredients as will be discussed infra.  The composition is adapted to be
introduced into the body (e.g., body cavity) of the person for mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack or stroke in the person.  Thus, the composition has a structural form being suitable for introduction of the
composition into the body a person such as, inter alia, one of the structural forms of FIGS. 1 4 or related structural forms as described infra, which depict structural forms of the composition of the present invention in accordance with embodiments
thereof.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 depicts chewable form 10, such as a wafer or a chewable pill.  Although FIG. 1 shows the chewable form 10 as being round, the chewable form may have any geometric shape, (e.g., circular, elliptical, rectangular square, triangular, etc.). 
The size of the chewable form 10 is of a size sufficient to contain all ingredients of the composition in the amounts desired.  For example, the chewable form 10 may be, inter alia, circular with a diameter of 11/2 inches and a thickness of 1/2 inch. 
The chewable form 10 is adapted to be chewed by the person for quick ingestion in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in a person.
<BR><BR> The structural form of the present invention may comprise a dissolvable form such as a dissolvable wafer or dissolvable pill, which may be constituted structurally similar to the chewable form 10 shown in FIG. 1.  The dissolvable form may
dissolve in the mouth of the person when held under the person's tongue, for quick absorption into the bloodstream of the person in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in the person.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 depicts the liquid form 20 contained in a vial or equivalent container 21 having a top 22.  The top 22 may be, inter alia, a screwable top, a puncturable top, etc. The liquid form 20 is adapted to be swallowed by the person for quick
ingestion in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in a person.  The liquid form 20 may alternatively be adapted to be introduced into the body of the person by injection through use of a needle or syringe (at any suitable point of
injection on the person's body).
<BR><BR> The structural form of the present invention may comprise an alternative dissolvable form such as a liquid, which may be constituted structurally similar to the liquid form 20 form shown in FIG. 1.  The dissolvable form may dissolve in the mouth
of the person when held under the person's tongue, for quick absorption into the bloodstream of the person in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in the person.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts the spray form 30 contained in a spray bottle or equivalent container 31 having a cover 32.  The cover 32 may be, inter alia, a screwable cover.  The spray form 30 may be any type of spray (e.g., aerosol spray in a pressurized
container 31) as is known in the art.  The spray form 30 is adapted to be sprayed into the nasal cavity of the person for quick absorption into the bloodstream of the person in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in the person.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 depicts a suppository form 40 for insertion into the anal cavity of the person for quick absorption into the bloodstream of the person in the event an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in the person.
<BR><BR> Irrespective of the structural form of the composition, the ingredients of the composition may be distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously within the composition.
<BR><BR> The composition of the present invention comprises four basic ingredients for providing a four-weapon simultaneous assault on the imminent or actually-occurring heart attack experienced by the person, inasmuch as the composition provides a blood
thinner (aspirin), a blood clot buster (nattokinase), a means for preventing or reducing damage to the heart (magnesium), and a blood vessel dilator (niacin or nitroglycerine).  Thus, the different therapeutic roles played by each of the four basic
ingredients composition is analogous to a military force simultaneously attacking the enemy in all four directions: north, south, east, and west.  As another military analogy, the different therapeutic roles played by each of the four basic ingredients
composition is analogous to using the four different branches of the armed services (i.e., army, navy, air force, marines) to attack the enemy.
<BR><BR> As a blood thinner, aspirin helps to prevent the formation of blood clots.  As a clot buster, nattokinase attacks fibrin clumps that clot blood vessels.  Nattokinase is an enzyme produced by a fermentation process in which the bacteria bacillus
natto is added to boiled soybeans.  If the person has a deficiency of magnesium, the person is likely to suffer more heart damage during a heart attack than does one not having a magnesium deficiency.  As a blood vessel dilator, niacin or nitroglycerine
improve blood circulation, thereby improving the transport of oxygen to the heart.
<BR><BR> The composition of the present invention may additionally comprise one or more of the following ingredients: L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, L-arginine, and coenzyme Q10.  L-carnitine (e.g., proprionyl L-carnitine) helps to increase blood flow
to the heart and to reduce or prevent heart enlargement.  Alpha lipoic acid is a fat and water soluble antioxidant that protects tissues from damage associated with low oxygen supply during a heart attack.  L-arginine increases local production of nitric
oxide, which dilates the smooth muscle found in the linings of blood vessels, thereby leading to a lowering of blood pressure.  L-arginine also inhibits aggregation of platelets wherein said platelets promote blood clotting.  Coenzyme Q10 increases blood
circulation and enhances oxygen levels in the heart muscle.
<BR><BR> The ingredients comprised by the composition of the present invention may each have a therapeutically effective amount for mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in the person.  The therapeutically effective
amount may be different for different persons.  Accordingly, the ingredients comprised by the composition of the present invention may exist, inter alia, in the amount shown in Table 1.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Ingredient Amount Aspirin 650 to 975 mg Magnesium 5000 to 15000 mg Nattokinase 150 to 3000 mg Niacin 500 to 3000 mg Nitroglycerine 0.4 to 2.5 mg L-carnitine 2000 to 9000 mg Alpha lipoic acid 200 to 10000 mg L-arginine 2000
to 12000 mg Coenzyme Q10 300 to 6000 mg
<BR><BR> The ingredients of the composition may be packaged with any base ingredient (e.g., soybean oil, lecithin, etc.) known to a person of ordinary skill in the art as being useful and practical for packaging analogous compositions.
<BR><BR> While the preceding discussion focused on a composition that mitigates adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring heart attack in a person, the composition of the present invention may be modified by adding Vitamin C, zinc, and Vitamin
E in therapeutic amounts so as to mitigate adverse effects resulting from heart surgery following a heart attack or otherwise conducted in the absence of a heart attack.  The Vitamin C, zinc, and Vitamin E may exist in the composition in the following
amounts: Vitamin C (1000 to 10000 mg); zinc (90 to 300 mg); and Vitamin E (2000 to 10000 International Units).
<BR><BR> It is noted that while a heart attack may be accompanied by blood clotting in a coronary artery so as to impede or block blood flow to the heart, a stroke may analogously be accompanied by blood clotting in a blood vessel leading to the brain so
as to impede or block blood flow to the brain.  Therefore, while the preceding discussion related to the beneficial effect of the ingredients of the composition of the present invention for mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring
heart attack in a person, the composition of the present invention is similarly useful for mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring stroke in the person.  More generally, the composition of the present invention is useful for
mitigating adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring pernicious thrombotic event in the person.  Examples of pernicious thrombotic event include heart attack, stroke, etc.
<BR><BR> While the preceding discussion focused on a composition that mitigates adverse effects of an imminent or actually-occurring thrombotic event in a person, the composition of the present invention may also be used to prevent a thrombotic event
that has a heightened probability of occurring in the person due to the person anticipating being subjected to a high level of physical or emotional stress; e.g., lifting weights in preparation for (or during) a weight-lifting contest, engaging in battle
during a military encounter, being a victim during an airplane hijacking, etc.
<BR><BR> While embodiments of the present invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, many modifications and changes will become apparent to those skilled in the art.  Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to encompass all
such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention.
