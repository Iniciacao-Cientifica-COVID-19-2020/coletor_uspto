<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> This invention relates to methods for preventing or treating Siglec-8 associated diseases by administration of antibodies or agonists that bind to human Siglec-8 or compositions comprising said antibodies or agonists.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) are single-pass transmembrane cell surface proteins found predominantly on leukocytes and are characterized by their specificity for sialic acids attached to cell-surface glycoconjugates. The Siglec family contains at least 15 members that are found in mammals (Pillai et al., Annu Rev Immunol., 30:357-392, 2012).  These members include sialoadhesion (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), CD33 (Siglec-3), myelin associated glycoprotein (Siglec-4),
Siglec-5, OBBP1 (Siglec-6), AIRM1 (Siglec-7), SAF-2 (Siglec-8), and CD329 (Siglec-9).  Siglec-8, a member that is expressed in humans but not in mouse, was first discovered as part of efforts to identify novel human eosinophil proteins.  In addition to
expression by eosinophils, it is also expressed by mast cells and basophils.  Siglec-8 recognizes a sulfated glycan, i.e., 6'-sulfo-sialyl Lewis X or 6'-sulfo-sialyl-N-acetyl-S-lactosamine, and contains an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain shown to inhibit mast cell function.
<BR><BR> Along with mast cells, eosinophils can promote an inflammatory response that plays a beneficial functional role such as controlling an infection at a specific tissue site.  During an inflammatory response, apoptosis of eosinophils can be
inhibited through the activity of survival-promoting cytokines such as IL-5 and GM-CSF.  However, an increase of activated eosinophils that are not rapidly removed by apoptosis can result in the release of eosinophil granule proteins at already inflamed
sites which can damage tissue and cause inflammation to be further exacerbated.  Examples of diseases that arise due to biological activity of mast cells and eosinophils include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and aspirin-exacerbated
respiratory disease (AERD), also known as Samter's Triad or aspirin-sensitive asthma.  CRSwNP is a serious disease which significantly impacts quality of life, and in many cases, is poorly managed with inhaled corticosteroids.  Mast-cell infiltration in
the nasal polyps has been shown to be prominent in both atopic and non-atopic individuals (Ruhno et al., Allergy, 45:370-374, 1990).  The nasal polyps in CRSwNP also contain large numbers of eosinophils and there is a correlation between peripheral
eosinophilia with polyp eosinophil infiltration (Hu et al., Laryngoscope, 122(3):498-503, 2012) as well as disease severity (Bryson et al., Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci., 28(1): 55-8, 2003).  AERD is also a serious disease as it is strongly associated
with near-fatal asthma (Szczeklik et al., Hypersensitivity to Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.  In: Middleton's Allergy, 7th edition., Mosby Elsevier, Philadelphia, Pa., 1227-1243, 2009) and has a protracted course even after avoidance
of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) (Kowalski M. L., http://www.worldallergy.org/professional/allergic_diseases_center/aspirin- /, originally posted May 2006).  In addition to aspirin-sensitive asthma, AERD patients have
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis.  Thus the disease is also considered a sub-set of CRSwNP with 30-40% of CRS patients estimated to be hypersensitive to aspirin (Szczeklik et al., Pharmacological Report, 62:526-529, 2010).  AERD is associated
with eosinophilic asthma and is characterized by the growth of nasal polyps containing large numbers of both eosinophils and mast cells as well as intense infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells into the entire respiratory mucosa (Stevenson et al.,
Clin Rev.  Allergy Immunol., 24: 169, 2003), often leading to aggressive airway remodeling (Steinke et al. J. Allergy., 2012:1-9, 2012).  Up to 50% of AERD patients require systemic corticosteroids to control their asthma.  However, the disease is poorly
managed with inhaled or oral steroids and patients typically require repeated surgery to remove recurring nasal polyps (Jenkins et al., BMJ.  328:434, 2004).  Therefore, there appears to be a need for alternative therapies that can control the activity
of immune cells involved in pathogenesis of these diseases, such as the activity of eosinophils and mast cells, due to poor disease management by currently available therapeutic treatments.

<BR><BR> The term "about" as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field.  Reference to "about" a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are
directed to that value or parameter per se.
<BR><BR> It is understood that aspects and embodiments of the invention described herein include "comprising," "consisting," and "consisting essentially of" aspects and embodiments.
<BR><BR> The term "antibody" includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific
antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab').sub.2, and Fv).  The term "immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used interchangeably with "antibody" herein.
<BR><BR> The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains.  An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional
polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain.  In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain
unit is generally about 150,000 daltons.  Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype.  Each H and L chain also has
regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges.  Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V.sub.H) followed by three constant domains (C.sub.H) for each of the .alpha.  and .gamma.  chains and four C.sub.H domains for .mu.  and .epsilon. 
isotypes.  Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V.sub.L) followed by a constant domain at its other end.  The V.sub.L is aligned with the V.sub.H and the C.sub.L is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C.sub.H1). 
Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.  The pairing of a V.sub.H and V.sub.L together forms a single antigen-binding site.  For the structure and properties of the
different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.
<BR><BR> The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.  Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of
their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes.  There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated .alpha., .delta., .epsilon., .gamma.  and .mu.,
respectively.  The .gamma.  and .alpha.  classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2.  IgG1
antibodies can exist in multiple polymorphic variants termed allotypes (reviewed in Jefferis and Lefranc 2009.  mAbs Vol 1 Issue 4 1-7) any of which are suitable for use in the invention.  Common allotypic variants in human populations are those
designated by the letters a, f, n, z.
<BR><BR> An "isolated" antibody is one that has been identified, separated and/or recovered from a component of its production environment (e.g., naturally or recombinantly).  In some embodiments, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all
other components from its production environment.  Contaminant components of its production environment, such as that resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses
for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes.  In some embodiments, the polypeptide is purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method,
and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or
reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or silver stain.  Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.  Ordinarily, however, an isolated
polypeptide or antibody is prepared by at least one purification step.
<BR><BR> The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally
occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts.  In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies have a C-terminal cleavage at the heavy chain and/or light chain.  For example,
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residues are cleaved at the C-terminus of heavy chain and/or light chain.  In some embodiments, the C-terminal cleavage removes a C-terminal lysine from the heavy chain.  In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies have an
N-terminal cleavage at the heavy chain and/or light chain.  For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residues are cleaved at the N-terminus of heavy chain and/or light chain.  In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed
against a single antigenic site.  In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against multiple antigenic sites (such as a bispecific antibody or a multispecific antibody).  The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the
character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.  For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in
accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display technologies, and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that
have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences.
<BR><BR> The term "naked antibody" refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
<BR><BR> The terms "full-length antibody," "intact antibody" or "whole antibody" are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antibody fragment.  Specifically whole antibodies include those with
heavy and light chains including an Fc region.  The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof.  In some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more
effector functions.
<BR><BR> An "antibody fragment" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody.  Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab').sub.2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear
antibodies (see U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng.  8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
<BR><BR> Papain digestion of antibodies produced two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc" fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily.  The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain
along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V.sub.H), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C.sub.H1).  Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site.  Pepsin treatment
of an antibody yields a single large F(ab').sub.2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.  Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments
by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the C.sub.H1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region.  Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a
free thiol group.  F(ab').sub.2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them.  Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
<BR><BR> The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides.  The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR)
found on certain types of cells.
<BR><BR> "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site.  This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association.  From the
folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody.  However, even a single variable domain
(or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
<BR><BR> "Single-chain Fv" also abbreviated as "sFv" or "scFv" are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain.  In some embodiments, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker
between the V.sub.H and V.sub.L domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.  For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag,
New York, pp.  269-315 (1994).
<BR><BR> "Functional fragments" of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fv region of an antibody which retains or has modified
FcR binding capability.  Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
<BR><BR> The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular
species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is (are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or
subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)).  Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include
PRIMATIZED.RTM.  antibodies wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with an antigen of interest.  As used herein, "humanized antibody" is used as a subset of "chimeric
antibodies."
<BR><BR> "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin.  In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in
which residues from an HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity.  In some instances, FR
residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues.  Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody.  These modifications may be made to
further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity.  In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond
to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody
performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. In some embodiments, the number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR are no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3.  The humanized antibody
optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.  For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988);
and Presta, Curr.  Op.  Struct.  Biol.  2:593-596 (1992).  See also, for example, Vaswani and Hamilton, Ann.  Allergy, Asthma & Immunol.  1:105-115 (1998); Harris, Biochem.  Soc.  Transactions 23:1035-1038 (1995); Hurle and Gross, Curr.  Op.  Biotech. 
5:428-433 (1994); and U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,982,321 and 7,087,409.  In some embodiments, humanized antibodies are directed against a single antigenic site.  In some embodiments, humanized antibodies are directed against multiple antigenic sites.  An
alternative humanization method is described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,981,843 and U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0134098.
<BR><BR> The "variable region" or "variable domain" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody.  The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as "VH" and "VL",
respectively.  These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.
<BR><BR> The term "hypervariable region," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody-variable domain that are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops.  Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in
the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3).  In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies.  See, e.g., Xu et al.
Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003)).  Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of
light chain.  See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993) and Sheriff et al., Nature Struct.  Biol.  3:733-736 (1996).
<BR><BR> A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein.  The HVRs that are Kabat complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of
Immunological Interest, 5.sup.th Ed.  Public Health Service, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.  (1991)).  Chothia HVRs refer instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol.  196:901-917 (1987)).  The "contact"
HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.  The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 Loop Kabat Chothia Contact L1 L24-L34 L26-L34 L30-L36 L2 L50-L56 L50-L56 L46-L55 L3 L89-L97 L91-L96 L89-L96 H1 H31-H35B H26-H32 H30-H35B (Kabat Numbering) H1 H31-H35 H26-H32 H30-H35 (Chothia Numbering) H2 H50-H65 H53-H56 H47-H58
H3 H95-H102 H95-H102 H93-H101
<BR><BR> Unless otherwise indicated, the variable-domain residues (HVR residues and framework region residues) are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra.
<BR><BR> "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.
<BR><BR> The expression "variable-domain residue-numbering as in Kabat" or "amino-acid-position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the
compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra.  Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. 
For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. 
The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
<BR><BR> An "acceptor human framework" for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework.  An acceptor human framework "derived
from" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes.  In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are
10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.
<BR><BR> "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide
sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.  Alignment for purposes of determining
percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software.  Those skilled in the art
can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.  For example, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid
sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is
calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be
appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.
<BR><BR> An antibody that "binds to", "specifically binds to" or is "specific for" a particular a polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide is one that binds to that particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without
substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.  In some embodiments, binding of an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) to an unrelated non-Siglec-8 polypeptide is less than
about 10% of the antibody binding to Siglec-8 as measured by methods known in the art (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)).  In some embodiments, an antibody that binds to a Siglec-8 (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) has a
dissociation constant (Kd) of .ltoreq.1 .mu.M, .ltoreq.100 nM, .ltoreq.10 nM, .ltoreq.2 nM, .ltoreq.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.7 nM, .ltoreq.0.6 nM, .ltoreq.0.5 nM, .ltoreq.0.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.01 nM, or .ltoreq.0.001 nM (e.g. 10.sup.-8 M or less, e.g. from 10.sup.-8
M to 10.sup.-13 M, e.g., from 10.sup.-9 M to 10.sup.-13 M).
<BR><BR> The term "anti-Siglec-8 antibody" or "an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8" refers to an antibody that binds to a polypeptide or an epitope of human Siglec-8 without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or epitope of an unrelated
non-Siglec-8 polypeptide.
<BR><BR> The term "Siglec-8" as used herein refers to a human Siglec-8 protein.  The term also includes naturally occurring variants of Siglec-8, including splice variants or allelic variants.  The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human Siglec-8 is
shown in SEQ ID NO:72.  The amino acid sequence of another exemplary human Siglec-8 is shown in SEQ ID NO:73.  In some embodiments, a human Siglec-8 protein comprises the human Siglec-8 extracellular domain fused to an immunoglobulin Fc region.  The
amino acid sequence of an exemplary human Siglec-8 extracellular domain fused to an immunoglobulin Fc region is shown in SEQ ID NO:74.  The amino acid sequence underlined in SEQ ID NO:74 indicates the Fc region of the Siglec-8 Fc fusion protein amino
acid sequence.

<BR><BR> Antibodies that "induce apoptosis" or are "apoptotic" are those that induce programmed cell death as determined by standard apoptosis assays, such as binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum,
cell fragmentation, and/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies).  For example, the apoptotic activity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibodies (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) of the present invention can be showed by staining
cells with annexin V.
<BR><BR> Antibody "effector functions" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype.  Examples of antibody
effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptors); and B cell
activation.
<BR><BR> "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" or "ADCC" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and macrophages)
enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins.  The antibodies "arm" the cytotoxic cells and are required for killing of the target cell by this
mechanism.  The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc.gamma.RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc.gamma.RI, Fc.gamma.RII and Fc.gamma.RIII.  Fc expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and
Kinet, Annu.  Rev.  Immunol.  9: 457-92 (1991).  In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) described herein enhances ADCC.  To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay,
such as that described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed.  Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and natural killer (NK) cells.  Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of
the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., PNAS USA 95:652-656 (1998).  Other Fc variants that alter ADCC activity and other antibody properties include those disclosed by Ghetie et
al., Nat Biotech.  15:637-40, 1997; Duncan et al, Nature 332:563-564, 1988; Lund et al., J. Immunol 147:2657-2662, 1991; Lund et al, Mol Immunol 29:53-59, 1992; Alegre et al, Transplantation 57:1537-1543, 1994; Hutchins et al., Proc Natl.  Acad Sci USA

<BR><BR> The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.  Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might
vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof.  Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the invention
include human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.  A single amino acid substitution (S228P according to Kabat numbering; designated IgG4Pro) may be introduced to abolish the heterogeneity observed in recombinant IgG4 antibody.  See Angal, S. et al. (1993) Mol
Immunol 30, 105-108.
<BR><BR> "Non-fucosylated" or "fucose-deficient" antibody refers to a glycosylation antibody variant comprising an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region has reduced fucose or lacks fucose.  In some embodiments, an antibody
with reduced fucose or lacking fucose has improved ADCC function.  Non-fucosylated or fucose-deficient antibodies have reduced fucose relative to the amount of fucose on the same antibody produced in a cell line.  In some embodiments, a non-fucosylated
or fucose-deficient antibody composition contemplated herein is a composition wherein less than about 50% of the N-linked glycans attached to the Fc region of the antibodies in the composition comprise fucose.
<BR><BR> The terms "fucosylation" or "fucosylated" refers to the presence of fucose residues within the oligosaccharides attached to the peptide backbone of an antibody.  Specifically, a fucosylated antibody comprises .alpha.  (1,6)-linked fucose at the
innermost N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue in one or both of the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to the antibody Fc region, e.g. at position Asn 297 of the human IgG1 Fc domain (EU numbering of Fc region residues).  Asn297 may also be located
about +3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e. between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in immunoglobulins.
<BR><BR> The "degree of fucosylation" is the percentage of fucosylated oligosaccharides relative to all oligosaccharides identified by methods known in the art e.g., in an N-glycosidase F treated antibody composition assessed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS).  In a composition of a "fully fucosylated antibody" essentially all oligosaccharides comprise fucose residues, i.e. are fucosylated.  In some embodiments, a composition of a fully
fucosylated antibody has a degree of fucosylation of at least about 90%.  Accordingly, an individual antibody in such a composition typically comprises fucose residues in each of the two N-linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region.  Conversely, in a
composition of a "fully non-fucosylated" antibody essentially none of the oligosaccharides are fucosylated, and an individual antibody in such a composition does not contain fucose residues in either of the two N-linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region. In some embodiments, a composition of a fully non-fucosylated antibody has a degree of fucosylation of less than about 10%.  In a composition of a "partially fucosylated antibody" only part of the oligosaccharides comprise fucose.  An individual antibody
in such a composition can comprise fucose residues in none, one or both of the N-linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region, provided that the composition does not comprise essentially all individual antibodies that lack fucose residues in the N-linked
oligosaccharides in the Fc region, nor essentially all individual antibodies that contain fucose residues in both of the N-linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region.  In one embodiment, a composition of a partially fucosylated antibody has a degree of
fucosylation of about 10% to about 80% (e.g., about 50% to about 80%, about 60% to about 80%, or about 70% to about 80%).
<BR><BR> "Binding affinity" as used herein refers to the strength of the non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen).  In some embodiments, the binding affinity of
an antibody for a Siglec-8 (which may be a dimer, such as the Siglec-8-Fc fusion protein described herein) can generally be represented by a dissociation constant (Kd).  Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those
described herein.
<BR><BR> "Binding avidity" as used herein refers to the binding strength of multiple binding sites of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen).
<BR><BR> An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibodies herein is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which
it was produced.  In some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components associated with the production environment.  The isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein is in a form
other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature.  Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from nucleic acid encoding the polypeptides and antibodies herein existing naturally in cells.
<BR><BR> The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation that is in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and that contains no additional components that are unacceptably toxic to an
individual to which the formulation would be administered.  Such formulations are sterile.
<BR><BR> "Carriers" as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed.  Often the physiologically acceptable
carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution.  Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues)
polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN.TM., polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS.TM..
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated during the course of clinical pathology.  Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the
rate of disease progression, ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis.  An individual is successfully "treated", for example, if one or more symptoms associated with a disorder (e.g., a Siglec-8 associated
disease) are mitigated or eliminated.  For example, an individual is successfully "treated" if treatment results in increasing the quality of life of those suffering from a disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required for treating the
disease, reducing the frequency of recurrence of the disease, lessening severity of the disease, delaying the development or progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of individuals.
<BR><BR> As used herein, "in conjunction with" refers to administration of one treatment modality in addition to another treatment modality.  As such, "in conjunction with" refers to administration of one treatment modality before, during or after
administration of the other treatment modality to the individual.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "prevention" includes providing prophylaxis with respect to occurrence or recurrence of a disease in an individual.  An individual may be predisposed to, susceptible to a disorder, or at risk of developing a disorder,
but has not yet been diagnosed with the disorder.  In some embodiments, anti-Siglec-8 antibodies (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) described herein are used to delay development of a disorder (e.g., a Siglec-8 associated disease).
<BR><BR> As used herein, an individual "at risk" of developing a disorder (e.g., a Siglec-8 associated disease) may or may not have detectable disease or symptoms of disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease or symptoms of disease
prior to the treatment methods described herein.  "At risk" denotes that an individual has one or more risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of the disease (e.g., a Siglec-8 associated disease), as known in the
art.  An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disorder than an individual without one or more of these risk factors.
<BR><BR> An "effective amount" refers to at least an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired or indicated effect, including a therapeutic or prophylactic result.  An effective amount can be provided in one
or more administrations.  A "therapeutically effective amount" is at least the minimum concentration required to effect a measurable improvement of a particular disorder.  A therapeutically effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as
the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual.  A therapeutically effective amount may also be one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody are
outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.  A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at the dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result.  Typically but not necessarily,
since a prophylactic dose is used in individuals prior to or at the earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount can be less than the therapeutically effective amount.
<BR><BR> "Chronic" administration refers to administration of the medicament(s) in a continuous as opposed to acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of time.  "Intermittent" administration is
treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature.
<BR><BR> As used herein, an "individual" or a "subject" is a mammal.  A "mammal" for purposes of treatment includes humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, rabbits, cattle, pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice,
ferrets, rats, cats, etc. In some embodiments, the individual or subject is a human.
<BR><BR> II.  Compositions and Methods
<BR><BR> A. Methods of the Invention
<BR><BR> Provided herein are methods for treating or preventing a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., AERD) in an individual comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of an antibody described herein that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g.,
an anti-Siglec-8 antibody), or compositions thereof.  Also provided herein are methods for treating or preventing a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., AERD) in an individual comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of an agonist
described herein that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing agonist or agonist antibodies), or compositions thereof.  In some embodiments, the individual (e.g., a human) has been diagnosed with a Siglec-8 associated disease
(e.g., AERD) or is at risk of developing the Siglec-8 associated disease.  As used herein the term "Siglec-8 associated disease" can refer to a disease, disorder or condition associated with increased proliferation (e.g., increased numbers) or activation
of Siglec-8 expressing cells.  Siglec-8 expressing cells include, but are not limited to, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells.  Non-limiting examples of Siglec-8 associated diseases that are treatable with the formulations of this present invention
include chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (e.g., atopic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis or non-atopic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and concomitant
asthma (e.g., atopic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and concomitant asthma or non-atopic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and concomitant asthma), aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (e.g., atopic aspirin-exacerbated
respiratory disease or non-atopic aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and adult onset non-atopic asthma with sinus disease.  In some embodiments, the Siglec-8 associated disease is an
eosinophil-mediated disorder.  In some embodiments, the Siglec-8 associated disease is a mast cell-mediated disorder.  In some embodiments, the Siglec-8 associated disease is a disease associated with impaired NK cell function (e.g., CRSwNP).  In some
embodiments, the individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease has impaired NK cell function.  In some embodiments, the individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease has impaired NK cell effector function (e.g., impaired NK cell-mediated ADCC activity).
<BR><BR> Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is characterized by mast-cell infiltration and eosinophil infiltration in the nasal polyps of both atopic and non-atopic individuals (Ruhno et al., Allergy, 45:370-374, 1990).  Mast
cells can also be found throughout the entire sinonasal mucosa in CRSwNP (Takabayashi et al 2011; Stevenson et al., Clin Rev.  Allergy Immunol., 24: 169, 2003).  Additionally, peripheral eosinophilia correlates with polyp eosinophil infiltration (Hu et
al., Laryngoscope, 122(3):498-503, 2012) and with disease severity (Bryson et al., Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci., 28(1): 55-8, 2003).  About 30% of CRSwNP patients have asthma which is associated with increased local IgE levels which are involved in the
regulation of chronic inflammation.  See Geveart et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 131(1):110-116, 2012.  As used herein an individual with "chronic rhinosinusitis" or "CRS" may or may not contain nasal polyps.  An adult (e.g., an individual) with CRS
will exhibit one or more of the following symptoms for 12 weeks or more: 1) inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either a) nasal blockage, obstruction or congestion, or b) nasal
discharge with anterior or posterior nasal drip; 2) facial pain or pressure; or 3) reduction or loss of smell.  A child (e.g., an individual) with CRS will exhibit one or more of the following symptoms for 12 weeks or more: 1) inflammation of the nose
and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either a) nasal blockage, obstruction or congestion, or b) nasal discharge with anterior or posterior nasal drip; 2) facial pain or pressure or 3) cough.  Additional
symptoms of CRS include, but are not limited to, ear pain or pressure, dizziness, halitosis, dental pain, nasal irritation, pharyngeal irritation, laryngeal irritation, tracheal irritation, dysphonia, cough, drowsiness, malaise, sleep disturbance, and
aspirin sensitivity.  An individual with "CRS without nasal polyposis" or "CRSsNP" has no visible polyps in middle meatus.  An individual with "CRS with nasal polyposis" or "CRSwNP" has bilateral polyps endoscopically visualized in middle meatus.  An
individual that has undergone sinus surgery may be diagnosed as having CRSwNP when the presence of polyps is found as bilateral pedunculated lesions as opposed to cobblestoned mucosa after more than 6 months post-surgery on endoscopic examination. 
Endocopic findings in an individual with CRS include one or more of polyps, mucopurulent discharge, oedema/mucosal obstruction.  An individual with CRS may also have mucosal changes within the osteomeatal complex and/or sinus when assessed by computed
tomography.  Several factors may be associated with CRSsNP or CRSwNP including, but not limited to, ciliary impairment (such as an individual with Karatagener's syndrome, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or cystic fibrosis), allergy, asthma, aspirin
sensitivity, an immunocompromised state (such as an individual infected with HIV), genetic history of family with CRSsNP or CRSwNP, pregnancy, biofilms of pathogenic bacteria (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), smoking,
infection with Helicobacter pylori, acid reflux, or osteitis.  See Lund et al., Rhinology, supplement 23:1-299, 2012.  In some embodiments, the individual with CRSwNP has impaired NK cell function.  In some embodiments, the individual with CRSwNP has
impaired NK cell effector function (e.g., impaired NK cell-mediated ADCC activity).
<BR><BR> Response to treatment in individuals with CRSsNP or CRSwNP can be assessed by methods well known in the art.  See Lund et al., Rhinology, supplement 23:1-299, 2012.  For example, reduction or improvement of a symptom in an individual with CRSsNP
or CRSwNP can be the improvement in sense of smell using a validated hyposmia-scoring methodology such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) of a smell-identification test from Sensonics Inc.  In other exemplary assays, the
Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20) and 22 (SNOT-22) are validated patient-reported measures of symptom severity and health-related QoL in sinonasal conditions (e.g., CRS).  Briefly, SNOT-22 contains 22 questions on CRS-related symptoms such as need to
blow nose; sneezing; runny nose nasal obstruction; loss of smell or taste; cough; post-nasal discharge; thick nasal discharge; ear fullness; dizziness; ear pain; facial pain or pressure; difficulty falling asleep; waking up at night; lack of a good
night's sleep; waking up tired; fatigue; reduced productivity; reduced concentration; frustration, restlessness, irritability; sadness; and embarrassment.  Symptom severity is graded zero to five with zero indicating no problem at all and five indicating
the worst possible symptom.  For each item, scores are added to produce a sum score on a scale ranging from zero to 110 with high score indicating a larger rhinosinusitis-related health burden.  The individual is also asked to identify which five items
is most important to them.  At the end of the questionnaire, the individual may state if they have had any symptoms that were not included among the 22 symptoms and asks the individual to indicate symptoms experienced over the past two weeks.  See Lange
et al., Dan Med Bul., 58(2):1-6, 2011.  Additional outcome measures including assessment of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion are known in the art by using known methodologies such as anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, nasal cytology, biopsy, and
bacteriology, sinus transillumination, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as additional assessments or diagnostic tests such as nasomucociliary clearance, ciliary beat frequency, production of nitric oxide, peak nasal
inspiratory flow measurement (PNIF), rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, rhinostereometry, olfaction threshold testing, and aspirin challenge.  For example, computed tomography (CT) x-ray scans of the nose and paranasal sinuses performed at baseline and
after treatment with an antibody or an agonist described herein are evaluated by using the Lund-Mackay scoring system.  See Lund et al., Rhinology, supplement 23:1-299, 2012; and van Spronsen et al., Allergy, 63:820-833, 2008.
<BR><BR> Asthma, also known as reversible obstructive airway disease, is characterized by hyperresponsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to respiratory irritants and bronchoconstrictor chemicals, producing attacks of wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness,
and cough that are reversible spontaneously or with treatment.  It is a chronic disease involving the entire airway, but varies in severity from occasional mild transient episodes to severe, chronic, life-threatening bronchial obstruction.  Physical
signs of an asthma attack include tachypnea, audible wheezing, and use of the accessory muscles of respiration.  Rapid pulse and elevated blood pressure are also typically present, as are elevated levels of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and nasal
secretions.  Asthma and atopy may coexist, but only about half of asthmatics are also atopic, and an even smaller percentage of atopic patients also have asthma.  However, atopy and asthma are not entirely independent in that asthma occurs more
frequently among atopic than amongst nonatopic individuals, especially during childhood.  Asthma has further been historically broken down into two subgroups, extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma.  In addition, asthma involves chronic inflammation of
the airways, acute exacerbations varying in frequency between different patients and in response to environmental triggers.  In severe cases, chronic remodeling of the airways may occur.
<BR><BR> Extrinsic asthma, also known as allergic, atopic or immunologic asthma, is descriptive of patients that generally develop asthma early in life, usually during infancy or childhood.  Other manifestations of atopy, including eczema or allergic
rhinitis often coexist.  Asthmatic attacks can occur during pollen seasons, in the presence of animals, or on exposure to house dust, feather pillows, or other allergens.  Skin tests show positive wheal-and-flare reactions to the causative allergens. 
Interestingly, serum total IgE concentrations are frequently elevated, but are sometimes normal.  Intrinsic asthma, also known as nonallergic or idopathic asthma, typically first occurs during adult life, after an apparent respiratory infection. 
Symptoms include chronic or recurrent bronchial obstruction unrelated to pollen seasons or exposure to other allergens.  Skin tests are negative to the usual atopic allergens, serum IgE concentration is normal.  Additional symptoms include sputum blood
and eosinophilia.  For purposes of this patent application, "eosinophil-mediated disorders", "mast-cell mediated disorders", "Siglec-8 associated disease", "CRSsNP with concomitant asthma" or "CRSwNP with concomitant asthma" includes both allergic and
non-allergic asthma.  Symptoms of asthma can be assessed using standard asthma scoring systems such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV.sub.1); reduction in frequency of asthma exacerbations; and reduction in the need for topical or systemic
steroids.
<BR><BR> Nasal polyps are benign edematous masses in the nasal cavities, paranasal cavities, or both that can cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and loss of smell.  See Geveart et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol.,
131(1):110-116, 2012.  Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract characterized by an outgrowth of inflamed tissue into the nasal cavity, and although the exact etiology is unknown, it is known to have prevalence
between 1 to 5% of adults (Settipane G A: Epidemiology of nasal polyps.  Allergy Asthma Proc, 1996, 17:231-236).  Nasal polyposis typically presents in males 20 years of age or older and causes nasal obstruction, hyposmia, and recurrent infections with a
significantly higher impact to quality of life than perennial allergic rhinitis (Li et al., J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol., 19(4):276-282, 2009).  Up to one third of all patients with nasal polyposis are reported to have asthma however only 7% of
asthma patients have nasal polyposis.  Predominate cell types implicated in nasal polyposis include eosinophils and mast cells which have been shown to infiltrate nasal polyps.  See (Ruhno et al., Allergy, 45:370-374, 1990) and (Hu et al., Laryngoscope,
122(3):498-503, 2012).  In some embodiments herein, reduction of nasal polyp size is assessed.  Standard methods of assessing nasal polyp size are known in the art.  See Gevaert et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 131(1):110-116, 2013.  In an exemplary
assay, total nasal endoscopic polyp scores (TPSs) are evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy at each visit and graded based on polyp size, resulting in scores of 0 to 4 for each nostril.  The scoring system is as follows: a score of 0 indicates no polyps;
1 represents small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 represents polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3 represents large polyps reaching the lower border of the
inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4 represents large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity.  The TPS is the sum of the left and right nostril scores (on a scale from 0 to 8).  Reduction in the need
for surgical intervention to remove polyps and clear the sinuses and nares may also be evaluated.  In some of the methods described herein, eosinophils are depleted in nasal polyps.
<BR><BR> Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) or Samter's Triad is strongly associated with near-fatal asthma (Szczeklik et al., Hypersensitivity to Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.  In: Middleton's Allergy, 7th edition., Mosby
Elsevier, Philadelphia, Pa., 1227-1243, 2009).  In addition to asthma, AERD patients have CRS with nasal polyps and ingestion of aspirin leads to both asthma and rhinitis attacks.  See Berges-Gimene et al., Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 89:474-478, 2002. 
Severe and uncontrolled CRS aggravates the course of asthma in these patients (Kowalski M. L., http://www.worldallergy.org/professionallallergic_diseases_center/aspirin- /, originally posted May 2006).  The disease is highly eosinophilic as it is
associated with eosinophilic asthma and is characterized by the growth of nasal polyps containing large numbers of both eosinophils and mast cells (more than 50% of total cells).  AERD is characterized by intense infiltration of eosinophils and mast
cells into the entire respiratory mucosa (Stevenson et al., Clin Rev.  Allergy Immunol., 24: 169, 2003), which can lead to aggressive airway remodeling (Steinke et al. J Allergy., 2012:1-9, 2012).  The polyps in AERD patients show similar histology to
those in aspirin-tolerant CRSwNP patients but show even more pronounced mast-cell and eosinophil involvement.  Eosinophil and mast-cell infiltration in AERD is described as intense or "devastating" (Stevenson et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 118:773-786,
2006).  AERD is considered to be a distinct disease with a different natural history to that of asthma.  For example it does not typically develop from childhood asthma but arises de novo, typically in the third to fifth decade of life as a severe
persistent disease associated with nasal polyposis.  Elevated levels of IL-4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) found in AERD have been implicated in the intense infiltration of both mast cells and eosinophils in this disease (Steinke et al. J Allergy.,
2012:1-9, 2012) and reduced apoptosis of both mast cells and eosinophils may be a contributory factor in the high levels of both cell types in the polyps (Kowalski M. L., http://www.worldallergy.org/professional/allergic_diseases_center/aspirin- /,
originally posted May 2006).  In some embodiments herein, an individual with chronic rhinosinusitis has aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
<BR><BR> Some individual have difficult to treat asthma where eosinophilic airway inflammation persists despite anti-inflammatory treatment.  This type of asthma can be associated with a more severe asthma, frequent exacerbations, and loss of lung
function.  A type of difficult to treat asthma is adult onset non-atopic asthma with sinus disease.  Individuals with adult onset non-atopic asthma with sinus disease have permanent sputum eosinophilia, later onset of asthma, are less often atopic, have
higher blood eosinophils, higher computed tomography sinus scores, and a lower FEV.sub.1 as compared to individuals without permanent sputum eosinophilia.  Some individuals also may have elevated levels of nitric oxide in exhaled air (FeNO).  Permanent
sputum eosinophilia is defined as sputum eosinophils .gtoreq.2% at baseline and at 5 years after baseline.  See van Veen et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 124(3):615617, 2009.
<BR><BR> Natural killer cells (NK cells) are cytotoxic lymphocytes that have been shown to play an important role in preventing inflammatory lung disease.  NK cell function has been found to be impaired in a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways
known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  COPD is a disease characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible.  The pathological hallmarks of COPD include chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and respiratory
bronchiolitis.  The inflammatory response in the central airways is known as chronic bronchitis and can be diagnosed clinically in individuals that regularly cough up sputum.  The inflammatory response can cause destruction of the tissues in the lung
such as the alveoli, a condition known as emphysema.  Methods of diagnosing COPD include lung function tests such as a spirometry test.  See Prieto et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med., 163(7):1578-83, 2001 and Fairclough et al., Clin Sci (Lond).,
114(8):533-41, 2008.  Furthermore, NK cells may regulate eosinophilic inflammation which is considered a pathological hallmark in individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).  Recently, impaired NK cell functions were found in individuals with CRS and
these individuals were associated with poor prognostic factors such as concomitant asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia.  This type of CRS is recalcitrant to medical and surgical therapy.  See Kim et al., PLoS ONE., 8(10):e77177, 2013.  Individuals
may have varying NK cell function due to polymorphisms in CD16, an Fc receptor on NK cells that mediates ADCC activity.  The CD16 encoding gene FCGR3A bears a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 526 [thymidine (T).fwdarw.guanine (G)]
resulting in an amino acid exchange at amino acid position 158 of phenylalanine (F) to valine (V).  It has been demonstrated that human IgG1 binds more efficiently to NK cells expressing the Fc.gamma.RIIIa-158V allotype than to the Fc.gamma.RIIIa-158F
allotype.  Individuals may have a CD16 158V/V genotype (i.e., 158V on both alleles of CD16), CD16 158F/F genotype (i.e., 158F on both alleles of CD16), or a CD16 158V/F genotype (i.e., 158V on one allele of CD16 and 158F on one allele of CD16).  See
Koene et al., Blood., 90(3):1109-14, 1997.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for treating or preventing a Siglec-8 associated disease in an individual with impaired natural killer (NK) cell function comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of an
antibody (e.g., an anti-Siglec-8 antibody) or agonist (e.g., a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing agonist) that binds to human Siglec-8.  In some embodiments herein, the Siglec-8 associated disease is chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and
concomitant asthma.  In some embodiments herein, the Siglec-8 associated disease is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  In some of the embodiments herein, one or more symptom in an individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., CRSwNP
and concomitant asthma) is reduced or improved (e.g., a reference value) relative to baseline after administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., an anti-Siglec-8 antibody).  In some of the embodiments herein, one or more symptom in
an individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., CRSwNP and concomitant asthma) is reduced or improved (e.g., a reference value) relative to baseline after administration of the agonist that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., a
6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing agonist).  In some of the embodiments herein, the impaired NK cell function is one or more of impaired NK cell degranulation, impaired NK cell cytokine production, and impaired NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  In some embodiments, the individual with impaired NK cell function has a CD16 158V/V genotype.  In some embodiments, the individual with impaired NK cell function has a CD16 158F/F genotype.  In some embodiments, the
individual with impaired NK cell function has a CD16 158V/F genotype.  In some embodiments, NK cell function is reduced (e.g., NK cell function is impaired) by at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about
80%, about 90% or about 100% in a sample obtained from the individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease and with impaired NK cell function as compared to a sample obtained from an individual without the Siglec-8 associated disease and with an equivalent
CD16 genotype.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for treating or preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in an individual comprising administering to the individual an effective amount of an antibody (e.g., an anti-Siglec-8
antibody) or agonist (e.g., a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing agonist) that binds to human Siglec-8.  In some of the embodiments herein, one or more symptom in an individual with COPD is reduced or improved (e.g., a reference value) relative to baseline

<BR><BR> The terms "baseline" or "baseline value" used interchangeably herein can refer to a measurement or characterization of a symptom before the administration of the therapy (e.g., an anti-Siglec-8 antibody) or at the beginning of administration of
the therapy.  The baseline value can be compared to a reference value in order to determine the reduction or improvement of a symptom of a Siglec-8 associated disease contemplated herein.  The terms "reference" or "reference value" used interchangeably
herein can refer to a measurement or characterization of a symptom after administration of the therapy (e.g., an anti-Siglec-8 antibody).  The reference value can be measured one or more times during a dosage regimen or treatment cycle or at the
completion of the dosage regimen or treatment cycle.  A "reference value" can be an absolute value; a relative value; a value that has an upper and/or lower limit; a range of values; an average value: a median value; a mean value; or a value as compared
to a baseline value.  Similarly, a "baseline value" can be an absolute value; a relative value; a value that has an upper and/or lower limit; a range of values; an average value; a median value; a mean value; or a value as compared to a reference value. 
The reference value and/or baseline value can be obtained from one individual, from two different individuals or from a group of individuals (e.g., a group of two, three, four, five or more individuals).  For example, an individual with a Siglec-8
associated disease (e.g., CRSwNP) can have an improved sense or level of smell after administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., a reference value) as compared to the sense or level of smell measured before or at the beginning of
administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 in the individual (e.g., a baseline value).  In another example, an individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., CRSwNP) can have an improved sense or level of smell after administration

baseline value).  In yet another example, an individual with a Siglec-8 associated disease (e.g., CRSwNP) can have an improved sense or level of smell after administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., a reference value) as compared
to the sense or level of smell measured before or at the beginning of administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 in a group of individuals (e.g., a baseline value).  In another example, a group of individuals with a Siglec-8 associated
disease (e.g., CRSwNP) can have an improved sense or level of smell after administration of the antibody that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., a reference value) as compared to the sense or level of smell measured before or at the beginning of

<BR><BR> In some embodiments, an individual described herein is administered an effective amount of an antibody or agonist that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, for depletion or reduction of eosinophils (e.g., eosinophils expressing
Siglec-8).  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes or reduces at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90% or about 100% of the eosinophils (e.g., eosinophils expressing Siglec-8) in a
sample obtained from the subject as compared to a baseline level before treatment.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes or reduces at least about 20% of the eosinophils (e.g., eosinophils expressing Siglec-8) in a sample obtained
from the subject as compared to a baseline level before treatment.  In some embodiments, the depletion or reduction of eosinophils is measured by comparing the eosinophil population number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample)
from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the eosinophil population number in a sample from an individual before treatment with the antibody or agonist.  In some embodiments, the depletion or reduction of eosinophils is measured
by comparing the eosinophil population number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample) from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the eosinophil population number in a sample from another individual without
the antibody treatment or the agonist treatment or average eosinophil population number in samples from individuals without the antibody treatment or the agonist treatment.  In some embodiments, the sample is a tissue sample (e.g., a skin sample, a lung
sample, a bone marrow sample, a nasal polyposis sample, etc.).  In some embodiments herein, the antibody depletes eosinophils in a tissue sample (e.g., a nasal polyps sample).  In some embodiments, the sample is a biological fluid sample (e.g., a blood
sample, a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, and a nasal lavage sample).  In some embodiments herein, the antibody depletes eosinophils in a biological fluid sample (e.g., a blood sample).  In some embodiments of the methods herein, the effective amount of
an antibody or agonist that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, induces apoptosis of activated eosinophils.  Eosinophils can be activated or sensitized by cytokines or hormones such as, but not limited to, IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-33, IFN-.gamma.,
TNF-.alpha., and leptin.  In some embodiments of the methods herein, the effective amount of an antibody or agonist described herein that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, induces apoptosis of resting eosinophils.  In some embodiments,
the effective amount of an antibody or agonist described herein that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, has antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against eosinophils.  In some embodiments, the effective amount of an
antibody or agonist described herein that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, prevents or reduces eosinophil production of inflammatory mediators.  Exemplary inflammatory mediators include, but are not limited to, reactive oxygen species,
granule proteins (e.g., eosinophil cationic protein, major basic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil peroxidase, etc.), lipid mediators (e.g., PAF, PGE1, PGE2, etc.), enzymes (e.g., elastase), growth factors (e.g., VEGF, PDGF, TGF-.alpha.,
TGF-.beta., etc.), chemokines (e.g., RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP4, eotaxin, etc.) and cytokines (e.g., IL-3, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-33, TNF-.alpha., etc.).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, an individual described herein is administered an effective amount of an antibody or agonist that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, for depletion or reduction of mast cells.  In some embodiments, the
depletion or reduction of mast cells is measured by comparing the mast cell population number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample) from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the mast cell population
number in a sample from an individual before treatment with the antibody or agonist.  In some embodiments, the depletion or reduction of mast cells is measured by comparing the mast cell population number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a
biological fluid sample) from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the mast cell population number in a sample from another individual without the antibody treatment or agonist treatment or average mast cell population number in
samples from individuals without the antibody treatment or agonist treatment.  In some embodiments, the sample is a tissue sample (e.g., a skin sample, a lung sample, a bone marrow sample, a nasal polyposis sample, etc.).  In some embodiments, the sample
is a biological fluid sample (e.g., a blood sample, a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, and a nasal lavage sample).  In some embodiments, the effective amount of an antibody or agonist described herein that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof,
has antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against mast cells.  In some embodiments, depletion or reduction of mast cells is the reduction or prevention of preformed or newly formed inflammatory mediators produced from mast cells. 
Exemplary inflammatory mediators include, but are not limited to, histamine, N-methyl histamine, enzymes (e.g., tryptase, chymase, cathespin G, carboxypeptidase, etc.), lipid mediators (e.g., prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4,
leukotriene C4, platelet-activating factor, 11-beta-prostaglandin F2, etc.), chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11 (i.e., eotaxin), CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL10, etc.), and cytokines (e.g., IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-15, IL-33, GM-CSF, TNF, etc.).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, an individual described herein is administered an effective amount of an antibody or agonist that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, for depleting mast cells expressing Siglec-8, wherein the anti-Siglec-8
antibody kills mast cells expressing Siglec-8 by ADCC activity.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes at least about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90% or about 100% of the mast cells
expressing Siglec-8 in a sample obtained from the subject as compared to a baseline level before treatment.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes at least about 20% of the mast cells expressing Siglec-8 in a sample obtained from the
subject as compared to a baseline level before treatment.  In some embodiments, the depletion or killing of mast cells is measured by comparing the mast cell population number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample) from a
subject after treatment with the antibody to the mast cell population number in a sample from a subject before treatment with the antibody.  In some embodiments, the depletion or killing of mast cells is measured by comparing the mast cell population
number in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample) from a subject after treatment with the antibody to the mast cell population number in a sample from another subject without the antibody treatment or average mast cell population
number in samples from subjects without the antibody treatment.  In some embodiments, the sample is a tissue sample (e.g., a skin sample, a lung sample, a bone marrow sample, a nasal polyposis sample, etc.).  In some embodiments, the sample is a
biological fluid sample (e.g., a blood sample, a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, and a nasal lavage sample).  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody has been engineered to improve ADCC activity.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody
comprises at least one amino acid substitution in the Fc region that improves ADCC activity.  In some embodiments, at least one or two of the heavy chains of the antibody is non-fucosylated.  In some embodiments, depletion or killing of mast cells is the
reduction or prevention of preformed or newly formed inflammatory mediators produced from mast cells.  Exemplary inflammatory mediators include, but are not limited to, histamine, N-methyl histamine, enzymes (e.g., tryptase, chymase, cathespin G,
carboxypeptidase, etc.), lipid mediators (e.g., prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, platelet-activating factor, 11-beta-prostaglandin F2, etc.), chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11 (i.e., eotaxin), CXCL1, CXCL2,
CXCL3, CXCL10, etc.), and cytokines (e.g., IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-15, IL-33, GM-CSF, TNF, etc.).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, an individual described herein is administered an effective amount of an antibody or agonist that binds to human Siglec-8, or compositions thereof, for the inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity.  In some embodiments, the
inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity is measured by comparing the mast cell-mediated activity in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a biological fluid sample) from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the mast cell-mediated
activity in a sample from an individual before treatment with the antibody or agonist.  In some embodiments, the inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity is measured by comparing the mast cell-mediated activity in a sample (e.g., a tissue sample or a
biological fluid sample) from an individual after treatment with the antibody or agonist to the mast cell-mediated activity in a sample from another individual without the antibody treatment or agonist treatment or average mast cell-mediated activity in
samples from individuals without the antibody treatment or agonist treatment.  In some embodiments, the sample is a tissue sample (e.g., a skin sample, a lung sample, a bone marrow sample, a nasal polyposis sample, etc.).  In some embodiments, the sample
is a biological fluid sample (e.g., a blood sample, a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, and a nasal lavage sample).  In some embodiments, inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity is the inhibition of mast cell degranulation.  In some embodiments,
inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity is the inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction.  In some embodiments, inhibition of mast cell-mediated activity is the inhibition of calcium flux in mast cells.  In some embodiments, inhibition of mast
cell-mediated activity is the inhibition of release of preformed or newly formed inflammatory mediators from mast cells.  Exemplary inflammatory mediators include, but are not limited to, histamine, N-methyl histamine, enzymes (e.g., tryptase, chymase,
cathespin G, carboxypeptidase, etc.), lipid mediators (e.g., prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, platelet-activating factor, 11-beta-prostaglandin F2, etc.), chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11 (i.e., eotaxin),

<BR><BR> Agonists of Siglec-8
<BR><BR> In one aspect, the present invention provides for agonists for use in any of the methods herein.  In some embodiments, an agonist is an agent that binds to Siglec-8 expressed on eosinophils and induces apoptosis of eosinophils in vitro or in
vivo.  In some embodiments, the agonist is an agonist antibody.  In some embodiments, the agonist antibody (e.g., antibody 2E2 provide herein) crosslinks Siglec-8 expressed by eosinophils and induces activation of one or more caspases (e.g., caspase-8,
caspase-3, and caspase-9) in eosinophils and/or loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.  See Nutku et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 336:918-924, 2005.  Siglec-8 binds to the glycan 6'-sulfo-sialyl Lewis X (also referred to herein as
6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X) and engagement to this glycan induces apoptosis of Siglec-8 expressing cells (e.g., eosinophils).  See Hudson et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther., 330(2):608-12, 2009.  In some embodiments herein, an agonist of Siglec-8 is a molecule having
a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X attached or linked to a molecule (e.g., a polymer, an oligosaccharide, a polypeptide, a glycoprotein, etc.).  In some embodiments herein, the agonist is a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing agonist molecule (e.g., a
6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing ligand, a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing oligosaccharide, a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing polypeptide, and a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing glycoprotein).
<BR><BR> Agonists may be identified from a variety of sources, for example, cells, cell-free preparations, chemical libraries, and natural product mixtures.  Such agonists may be natural or modified substrates, ligands, receptors, oligonucleotides,
polypeptides, or antibodies that contain the glycan 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X and bind to Siglec-8, or may be structural or functional mimetics thereof.  Structural or functional mimetics of such natural or modified substrates, ligands, receptors,
oligonucleotides, or antibodies that contain the glycan 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X are referred to herein as a "6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing glycomimetic." See Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1 (2):Chapter 5, 1991.  For example, a
6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing glycomimetic may be a synthetic polymer-based ligand decorated with 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X that structurally or functionally mimics the activity of the natural ligand of Siglec-8.  See Hudson et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther.,
330(2):608-12, 2009 for examples of glycomimetics contemplated herein.  Other examples of potential agonists include antibodies or, in some cases, oligonucleotides or polypeptides which are closely related to the natural ligand of Siglec-8, or small
molecules which bind to Siglec-8.  Synthetic compounds that mimic the conformation and desirable features of a particular polysaccharide ligand (e.g., a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing ligand) that binds to Siglec-8, and preferably avoid at least some
undesirable features (such as low binding affinity, short half-life in vivo, and the like) of the original polysaccharide ligand of interest (e.g., a 6'-sulfo-sLe.sup.X-containing ligand), are referred to herein as "mimetics".  See U.S.  Pat.  No.
8,178,512 for examples of mimetics contemplated herein.
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an agonist that binds to human Siglec-8 (e.g., 6'-sulfo-sLeX-containing agonist or an antibody) described herein induces apoptosis of eosinophils.  Apoptosis of eosinophils can be assessed by methods well known in the art.  See
Hudson et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther., 330(2):608-12, 2009 and Nutku et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 336:918-924, 2005.  For example, human eosinophils are isolated from peripheral blood, purified, and cultured for 24 or 72 hours in IL-5 followed by
incubation with the agonist that binds to human Siglec-8 for an additional 24 hours.  Cell survival is then assessed by flow cytometric analysis after labeling with annexin-V and propidium iodide.  Agonist activity may also be assessed using by detecting
activation of caspases (e.g., caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-9) in eosinophils and/or loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in eosinophils.  These assays are described in Nutku et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 336:918-924, 2005.

biological fluid (e.g., blood).
<BR><BR> 1.  Antibody Affinity
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein binds to human Siglec-8 with about the same or higher affinity and/or higher avidity as compared mouse antibody 2E2 and/or mouse antibody 2C4.  In certain embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8
antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of .ltoreq.1 .mu.M, .ltoreq.150 nM, .ltoreq.100 nM, .ltoreq.50 nM, .ltoreq.10 nM, .ltoreq.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.1 nM, .ltoreq.0.01 nM, or .ltoreq.0.001 nM (e.g. 10.sup.-8 M or less, e.g. from 10.sup.-8
M to 10.sup.-13 M, e.g., from 10.sup.-9 M to 10.sup.-13 M).  In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein binds to human Siglec-8 at about 1.5-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold,
about 8-fold, about 9-fold or about 10-fold higher affinity than mouse antibody 2E2 and/or mouse antibody 2C4.  In some embodiments herein, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
NO:6; and/or a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:16 or 21.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the binding affinity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can be determined by a surface plasmon resonance assay.  For example, the Kd or Kd value can be measured by using a BIAcore.TM.-2000 or a BIAcore.TM.-3000 (BIAcore, Inc.,
Piscataway, N.J.) at 25.degree.  C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at .about.10 response units (RU).  Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore.RTM.  Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions.  Capture antibodies (e.g., anti-human-Fc) are diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, before injection at a flow rate of 30 .mu.l/minute and further
immobilized with an anti-Siglec-8 antibody.  For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of dimeric Siglec-8 are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25.degree.  C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 .mu.l/min. Association rates (kon)
and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore.RTM.  Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams.  The equilibrium dissociation constant
(Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon.  See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol.  293:865-881.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, biolayer interferometry may be used to determine the affinity of anti-Siglec-8 antibodies against Siglec-8.  In an exemplary assay, Siglec-8-Fc tagged protein is immobilized onto anti-human capture sensors, and incubated
with increasing concentrations of mouse, chimeric, or humanized anti-Siglec-8 Fab fragments to obtain affinity measurements using an instrument such as, for example, the Octet Red 384 System (ForteBio).
<BR><BR> The binding affinity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can, for example, also be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980) using standard techniques well known in the relevant art.  See also
Scatchard, G., Ann.  N.Y.  Acad.  Sci.  51:660 (1947).
<BR><BR> 1.  Antibody Avidity
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the binding avidity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can be determined by a surface plasmon resonance assay.  For example, the Kd or Kd value can be measured by using a BIAcore T100.  Capture antibodies (e.g., goat-anti-human-Fc
and goat-anti-mouse-Fc) are immobilized on a CM5 chip.  Flow-cells can be immobilized with anti-human or with anti-mouse antibodies.  The assay is conducted at a certain temperature and flow rate, for example, at 25.degree.  C. at a flow rate of 30
.mu.l/min. Dimeric Siglec-8 is diluted in assay buffer at various concentrations, for example, at a concentration ranging from 15 nM to 1.88 pM.  Antibodies are captured and high performance injections are conducted, followed by dissociations.  Flow
cells are regenerated with a buffer, for example, 50 mM glycine pH 1.5.  Results are blanked with an empty reference cell and multiple assay buffer injections, and analyzed with 1:1 global fit parameters.
<BR><BR> 2.  Competition Assays
<BR><BR> Competition assays can be used to determine whether two antibodies bind the same epitope by recognizing identical or sterically overlapping epitopes or one antibody competitively inhibits binding of another antibody to the antigen.  These assays
are known in the art.  Typically, antigen or antigen expressing cells is immobilized on a multi-well plate and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured.  Common labels for such competition assays are
radioactive labels or enzyme labels.  In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein competes with a 2E2 antibody described herein, for binding to the epitope present on the cell surface of a cell (e.g., an eosinophil).  In some
embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein competes with an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, and a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
NO:15, for binding to the epitope present on the cell surface of a cell (e.g., an eosinophil).  In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein competes with a 2C4 antibody described herein, for binding to the epitope present on the cell
surface of a cell (e.g., an eosinophil).  In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein competes with an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (as found in U.S.  Pat.  No.
8,207,305), and a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 (as found in U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,207,305), for binding to the epitope present on the cell surface of a cell (e.g., an eosinophil).
<BR><BR> 3.  Thermal Stability
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 described herein has a melting temperature (Tm) of at least about 70.degree.  C., at least about 71.degree.  C., or at least about 72.degree.  C. in a thermal shift assay.  In an exemplary thermal shift assay,
samples comprising a humanized anti-Siglec-8 antibody are incubated with a fluorescent dye (Sypro Orange) for 71 cycles with 1.degree.  C. increase per cycle in a qPCR thermal cycler to determine the Tm.  In some embodiments herein, the anti-Siglec-8
antibody has a similar or higher Tm as compared to mouse 2E2 antibody and/or mouse 2C4 antibody.  In some embodiments herein, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6; and/or a
light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs:16 or 21.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody has the same or higher Tm as compared to a chimeric 2C4 antibody.  In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8
antibody has the same or higher Tm as compared to an antibody having a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:84 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:85.
<BR><BR> 4.  Biological Activity Assays
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein induces apoptosis of eosinophils.  In some other aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein depletes mast cells.  Assays for assessing apoptosis of cells are well known in the
art, for example staining with Annexin V and the TUNNEL assay.  In an exemplary cell apoptosis assay, fresh buffy coat from a blood sample is resuspended in media and plated in a 96-well U-bottom plate.  A series of serial 5-fold dilutions of
anti-Siglec-8 antibody is added to each well and the plate is incubated at 37.degree.  C. at 5% CO.sub.2 for greater than four hours.  The cells are fixed with paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS and stained with conjugated antibodies specific for
eosinophils for detection using a microscope.  The eosinophil population in the total peripheral blood leukocytes is evaluated when the buffy coat is incubated in the presence of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody as compared to when the buffy coat is not
incubated in the presence of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody.  In another exemplary assay, eosinophils purified from a blood sample (e.g., Miltenyi Eosinophil Isolation Kit) are resuspended in media and cultured in the presence or absence of IL-5 overnight. 
The cultured eosinophils are subsequently harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in media, and plated in a 96-well U-bottom plate.  A series of serial 5-fold dilutions of anti-Siglec-8 antibody is added to each well and the plate is incubated at
37.degree.  C. at 5% CO.sub.2 for greater than four hours.  The cells are fixed and stained with Annexin-V using standard techniques well known in the art the number of eosinophils is detected using a microscope.  The eosinophil population in the sample
is evaluated when the purified cells are incubated in the presence of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody as compared to when the purified cells are not incubated in the presence of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody.
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein induces ADCC activity.  In some other aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein kills mast cells expressing Siglec-8 by ADCC activity.  In some embodiments, a composition
comprises non-fucosylated (i.e., afucosylated) anti-Siglec-8 antibodies.  In some embodiments, a composition comprising non-fucosylated anti-Siglec-8 antibodies described herein enhances ADCC activity as compared to a composition comprising partially
fucosylated anti-Siglec-8 antibodies.  Assays for assessing ADCC activity are well known in the art and described herein.  In an exemplary assay, to measure ADCC activity, effector cells and target cells are used.  Examples of effector cells include
natural killer (NK) cells, large granular lymphocytes (LGL), lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and PBMC comprising NK and LGL, or leukocytes having Fc receptors on the cell surfaces, such as neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages.  The target
cell is any cell which expresses on the cell surface antigens that antibodies to be evaluated can recognize.  An example of such a target cell is an eosinophil which expresses Siglec-8 on the cell surface.  Another example of such a target cell is a mast
cell which expresses Siglec-8 on the cell surface.  Target cells are labeled with a reagent that enables detection of cytolysis.  Examples of reagents for labeling include a radio-active substance such as sodium chromate (Na.sub.2 .sup.51CrO.sub.4). 
See, e.g., Immunology, 14, 181 (1968); J. Immunol.  Methods., 172, 227 (1994); and J. Immunol.  Methods., 184, 29 (1995).
<BR><BR> In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein inhibits mast cell-mediated activities.  Mast cell tryptase has been used as a biomarker for total mast cell number and activation.  For example, total and active tryptase as well as
histamine, N-methyl histamine, and 11-beta-prostaglandin F2 can be measured in blood or urine to assess the reduction in mast cells.  See, e.g., U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. US 20110293631 for an exemplary mast cell activity assay.  In an
exemplary assay to assess ADCC and apoptotic activity of anti-Siglec-8 antibodies on mast cells, human mast cells are isolated from human tissues according to published protocols (Guhl et al., Biosci.  Biotechnol.  Biochem., 2011, 75:382-384; Kulka et
al., In Current Protocols in Immunology, 2001, (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)) or differentiated from human hematopoietic stem cells, for example as described by Yokoi et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 2008, 121:499-505.  Purified mast cells are resuspended in
Complete RPMI medium in a sterile 96-well U-bottom plate and incubated in the presence or absence of anti Siglec-8 antibodies for 30 minutes at concentrations ranging between 0.0001 ng/ml and 10 .mu.g/ml.  Samples are incubated for a further 4 to 16
hours with and without purified natural killer (NK) cells or fresh PBL to induce ADCC.  Cell-killing by apoptosis or ADCC is analyzed by flow cytometry using fluorescent conjugated antibodies to detect mast cells (CD117 and Fc.epsilon.R1) and Annexin-V
and 7AAD to discriminate live and dead or dying cells.  Annexin-V and 7AAD staining are performed according to manufacturer's instructions.
<BR><BR> Antibody Preparation
<BR><BR> The antibody described herein (e.g., an antibody that binds to human Siglec-8) is prepared using techniques available in the art for generating antibodies, exemplary methods of which are described in more detail in the following sections.
<BR><BR> 1.  Antibody Fragments
<BR><BR> The present invention encompasses antibody fragments.  Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or by recombinant techniques.  In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody
fragments, rather than whole antibodies.  For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. (2003) Nat.  Med.  9:129-134.
<BR><BR> Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments.  Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical
Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)).  However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells.  Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus
allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments.  Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above.  Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to
form F(ab').sub.2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992)).  According to another approach, F(ab).sub.2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture.  Fab and F(ab').sub.2 fragment with increased in vivo
half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,869,046.  Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.  In certain embodiments, an antibody is a
single chain Fv fragment (scFv).  See WO 93/16185; U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,571,894; and 5,587,458.  Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding
during in vivo use.  scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv.  See Antibody Engineering, ed.  Borrebaeck, supra.  The antibody fragment may also be a "linear
antibody", e.g., as described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,641,870, for example.  Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.
<BR><BR> 2.  Humanized Antibodies
<BR><BR> The invention encompasses humanized antibodies.  Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art.  For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is
non-human.  These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain.  Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter (Jones et al. (1986) Nature
321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239:1534-1536), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody.  Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are
chimeric antibodies (U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species.  In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies
in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
<BR><BR> The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity.  According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent
(e.g., mouse) antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences.  The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al. (1993) J.
Immunol.  151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol.  196:901.  Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains.  The same framework may be used
for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al. (1992) Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 89:4285; Presta et al. (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2623.
<BR><BR> It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties.  To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a
process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences.  Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those,
skilled in the art.  Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences.  Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of
the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen.  In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the
recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved.  In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing
antigen binding.
<BR><BR> 3.  Human Antibodies
<BR><BR> Human anti-Siglec-8 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s).  Alternatively, human
monoclonal anti-Siglec-8 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method.  Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor J. Immunol.,
133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.  51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).
<BR><BR> It is possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production.  For example, it has been described that
the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production.  Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such
germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge.  See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in
Immunol., 7: 33 (1993).
<BR><BR> Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody.  According to this method, which is also
called "epitope imprinting", either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of
non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras.  Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding
non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e., the epitope governs the choice of the human chain partner.  When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO 93/06213
published Apr.  1, 1993).  Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.
<BR><BR> 4.  Bispecific Antibodies
<BR><BR> Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens.  In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies.  In certain embodiments, one of the binding
specificities is for Siglec-8 and the other is for any other antigen.  In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of Siglec-8.  Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which
express Siglec-8.  Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab').sub.2 bispecific antibodies).
<BR><BR> Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art.  See Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305: 537 (1983), WO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993, and Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10: 3655 (1991).  For further details of generating bispecific
antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).  Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies.  For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other
to biotin.  Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking method.  Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.
<BR><BR> 5.  Single-Domain Antibodies
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain antibody.  A single-domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable
domain of an antibody.  In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,248,516 B1).  In one embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a
portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.
<BR><BR> 6.  Antibody Variants
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated.  For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody.  Amino acid
sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis.  Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or
substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody.  Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. 
The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.
<BR><BR> A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning mutagenesis" as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085.  Here, a
residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with
antigen.  Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution.  Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence
variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined.  For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the
expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.
<BR><BR> Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid
residues.  Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue.  Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme or a polypeptide which
increases the serum half-life of the antibody.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies have a C-terminal cleavage at the heavy chain and/or light chain.  For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residues are cleaved at the C-terminus of heavy chain and/or light chain.  In some
embodiments, the C-terminal cleavage removes a C-terminal lysine from the heavy chain.  In some embodiments, monoclonal antibodies have an N-terminal cleavage at the heavy chain and/or light chain.  For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acid residues are
cleaved at the N-terminus of heavy chain and/or light chain.  In some embodiments, truncated forms of monoclonal antibodies can be made by recombinant techniques.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated.  Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked.  N-linked refers to the attachment
of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue.  The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the
carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain.  Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site.  O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars
N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.
<BR><BR> Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites) is created or
removed.  The alteration may also be made by the addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).
<BR><BR> Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered.  For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No
US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.).  See also US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd).  Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003/011878, Jean-Mairet et
al. and U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.) and WO
1999/22764 (Raju, S.) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof.  See also US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.) on antigen-binding molecules with modified glycosylation.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, a glycosylation variant comprises an Fc region, wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose.  Such variants have improved ADCC function.  Optionally, the Fc region further comprises one or more
amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC, for example, substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues).  Examples of publications related to "defucosylated" or "fucose-deficient" antibodies
include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742;
Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol.  336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech.  Bioeng.  87: 614 (2004).  Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch.  Biochem. Biophys.  249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1 1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (Yamane-Ohnuki et
al. Biotech.  Bioeng.  87: 614 (2004)), and cells overexpressing .beta.1,4-N-acetylglycosminyltransferase III (GnT-III) and Golgi .mu.-mannosidase II (ManII).
<BR><BR> Antibodies are contemplated herein that have reduced fucose relative to the amount of fucose on the same antibody produced in a wild-type CHO cell.  For example, the antibody has a lower amount of fucose than it would otherwise have if produced
by native CHO cells (e.g., a CHO cell that produce a native glycosylation pattern, such as, a CHO cell containing a native FUT8 gene).  In certain embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody provided herein is one wherein less than about 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%,
10%, 5% or 1% of the N-linked glycans thereon comprise fucose.  In certain embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody provided herein is one wherein none of the N-linked glycans thereon comprise fucose, i.e., wherein the antibody is completely without
fucose, or has no fucose or is non-fucosylated or is afucosylated.  The amount of fucose can be determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn297 (e.g.,
complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example.  Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (Eu numbering of Fc region
residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about +3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies.  In some embodiments, at least one or two of the heavy chains
of the antibody is non-fucosylated.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the antibody is altered to improve its serum half-life.  To increase the serum half-life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described
in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,739,277, for example.  As used herein, the term "salvage receptor binding epitope" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum
half-life of the IgG molecule (US 2003/0190311, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,821,505; 6,165,745; 5,624,821; 5,648,260; 6,165,745; 5,834,597).
<BR><BR> Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant.  These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue.  Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the
hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated.  Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of "preferred substitutions." If such substitutions result in a desirable change in biological activity, then more
substantial changes, denominated "exemplary substitutions" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00013 TABLE 1 Preferred Original Residue Exemplary Substitutions Substitutions Ala (A) Val; Leu; Ile Val Arg (R) Lys; Gln; Asn Lys Asn (N) Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg Gln Asp (D) Glu; Asn Glu Cys (C) Ser; Ala Ser Gln (Q) Asn; Glu Asn Glu

<BR><BR> Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the
substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or c) the bulk of the side chain.  Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side
chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp.  73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)): (1) non-polar.  Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M) (2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr
(Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q) (3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E) (4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H)
<BR><BR> Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile; (2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser.  Thr, Asn, Gln: (3) acidic: Asp, Glu; (4)
basic: His, Lys, Arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; (6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.
<BR><BR> Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.  Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.
<BR><BR> One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody).  Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have
modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated.  A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display.  Briefly, several hypervariable
region sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site.  The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene
III product of M13) packaged within each particle.  The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity).  In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis
(e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding.  Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to
identify contact points between the antibody and antigen.  Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein.  Once such variants are generated, the
panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.
<BR><BR> Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art.  These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally
occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.
<BR><BR> It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant.  The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g., a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.  In some embodiments, the Fc region variant comprises a human IgG4 Fc region.  In a further
embodiment, the human IgG4 Fc region comprises the amino acid substitution S228P, wherein the amino acid residues are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat.
<BR><BR> In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc
region.  These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart.  For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that
would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in WO99/51642.  See also Duncan & Winter Nature 322:738-40 (1988); U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,648,260; 5,624,821; and
WO94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.  WO00/42072 (Presta) and WO 2004/056312 (Lowman) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs.  The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated
herein by reference.  See, also, Shields et al. J. Biol.  Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).  Antibodies with increased half-lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus
(Guyer et al., J. Immunol.  117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol.  24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.).  These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc
region to FcRn.  Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,194,551B1, WO99/51642.  The contents of those patent publications are specifically
incorporated herein by reference.  See, also, Idusogie et al. J. Immunol.  164: 4178-4184 (2000).
<BR><BR> 7.  Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods
<BR><BR> For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression.  DNA encoding the antibody is readily
isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody).  Many vectors are available.  The choice of vector depends
in part on the host cell to be used.  Generally, host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin.  It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and
IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.
<BR><BR> Generating Antibodies Using Prokaryotic Host Cells:
<BR><BR> a) Vector Construction
<BR><BR> Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques.  Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such
as hybridoma cells.  Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques.  Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing
heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts.  Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention.  Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be
inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector.  Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with
the particular host cell in which it resides.  The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid
insert and a transcription termination sequence.
<BR><BR> In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts.  The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking
sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells.  For example, E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species.  pBR322 contains genes-encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline
(Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells.  pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for
expression of endogenous proteins.  Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,648,237.
<BR><BR> In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts.  For example, bacteriophage such as .lamda.GEM.TM.-11 may be
utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as E. coli LE392.
<BR><BR> The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components.  A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5') to a cistron that modulates its
expression.  Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive.  Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture
condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.
<BR><BR> A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known.  The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via
restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention.  Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes.  In
some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.
<BR><BR> Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the .beta.-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter.  However, other
promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well.  Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target
light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.
<BR><BR> In one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane.  In general, the signal sequence may be a
component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector.  The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal
peptidase) by the host cell.  For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the
group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP.  In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are
STII signal sequences or variants thereof.
<BR><BR> In another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron.  In that regard,
immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm.  Certain host strains (e.g., the E. coli trxB-strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond
formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits.  Proba and Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995).
<BR><BR> Antibodies of the invention can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of
the invention.  Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.
<BR><BR> One technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,840,523.  It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron.  For a given TIR, a series of amino acid or
nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain.  TIR variants can be generated by
conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence.  In certain embodiments, changes in the nucleotide sequence are silent.  Alterations in the TIR can include, for example, alterations in the number
or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with alterations in the signal sequence.  One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a "codon bank" at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid
sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent).  This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second
positions that can add complexity in making the bank.  This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992) METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol.  4:151-158.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein.  This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under
various TIR strength combinations.  TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,840,523.  Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired
individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.
<BR><BR> Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms.  Examples of useful bacteria include Escherichia (e.g., E. coli), Bacilli (e.g.,
B. subtilis), Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas species (e.g., P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or Paracoccus.  In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used.  In one
embodiment, E. coli cells are used as hosts for the invention.  Examples of E. coli strains include strain W3110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp.  1190-1219; ATCC Deposit
No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 .DELTA.fhuA (.DELTA.tonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 .DELTA.ompT.DELTA.(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,639,635).  Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as E. coli
294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B, E. coli.lamda.  1776 (ATCC 31,537) and E. coli RV308 (ATCC 31,608) are also suitable.  These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.  Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having
defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990).  It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a
bacterium.  For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon.  Typically the host cell should secrete minimal
amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.
<BR><BR> b) Antibody Production
<BR><BR> Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.
<BR><BR> Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant.  Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques
appropriate to such cells.  The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers.  Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO.  Yet another technique
used is electroporation.
<BR><BR> Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells.  Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient
supplements.  In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector.  For example, ampicillin is added
to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.
<BR><BR> Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. 
Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.
<BR><BR> The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures.  In certain embodiments, for E. coli growth, growth temperatures range from about 20.degree.  C. to about 39.degree.  C.; from about 25.degree.  C. to about 37.degree.  C.; or
about 30.degree.  C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism.  In certain embodiments, for E. coli, the pH is from about 6.8 to about 7.4, or about 7.0.
<BR><BR> If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter.  In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling
transcription of the polypeptides.  Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction.  In certain embodiments, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P.  medium (see, e.g., Simmons et al., J. Immunol. 
Methods (2002), 263:133-147).  A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells.  Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic
shock, sonication or lysis.  Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration.  The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography.  Alternatively, proteins can be
transported into the culture media and isolated therein.  Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced.  The expressed polypeptides can be further
isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.
<BR><BR> In one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process.  Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins.  Large-scale fermentations
have at least 1000 liters of capacity, and in certain embodiments, about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity.  These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose.  Small scale fermentation refers generally to
fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.
<BR><BR> In a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early
stationary phase.  A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above.  Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction.  Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours,
although longer or shorter induction time may be used.
<BR><BR> To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified.  For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors
overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells.  The chaperone proteins have been
demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells.  Chen et al. (1999) J. Biol.  Chem. 274:19601-19605; Georgiou et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,083,715; Georgiou et al., U.S.  Pat.  No.
6,027,888; Bothmann and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol.  Chem. 275:17100-17105; Ramm and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol.  Chem. 275:17106-17113; Arie et al. (2001) Mol. Microbiol.  39:199-210.
<BR><BR> To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention.  For example, host cell strains may
be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof.  Some E. coli protease-deficient strains are
available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., Microbial Drug Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996).
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, E. coli strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.
<BR><BR> c) Antibody Purification
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses.  Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed.  The
following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE,
chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.
<BR><BR> In one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention.  Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from Staphylococcus aureas which binds with a high affinity to the
Fc region of antibodies.  Lindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol.  Meth.  62:1-13.  The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column.  In some
applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.
<BR><BR> As the first step of purification, a preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would
then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase.  Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.
<BR><BR> Generating Antibodies Using Eukaryotic Host Cells:
<BR><BR> A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell generally includes one or more of the following non-limiting components: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription
termination sequence.
<BR><BR> a) Signal Sequence Component
<BR><BR> A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest.  The heterologous signal sequence selected may
be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell.  In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.  The
DNA for such a precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.
<BR><BR> b) Origin of Replication
<BR><BR> Generally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors.  For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.
<BR><BR> c) Selection Gene Component
<BR><BR> Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker.  Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or
tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.
<BR><BR> One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell.  Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. 
Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.
<BR><BR> Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, primate
metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.
<BR><BR> For example, in some embodiments, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR.  In some
embodiments, an appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).
<BR><BR> Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside
3'-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418.  See U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,965,199.  Host cells may include
NS0, CHOK1, CHOK1SV or derivatives, including cell lines deficient in glutamine synthetase (GS).  Methods for the use of GS as a selectable marker for mammalian cells are described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,122,464 and 5,891,693.
<BR><BR> d) Promoter Component
<BR><BR> Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., an antibody).  Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes.  For
example, virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated.  Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is
a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide.  At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence.  In certain embodiments, any or all of these
sequences may be suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.
<BR><BR> Transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma
virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the
host cell systems.
<BR><BR> The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication.  The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained
as a HindIII E restriction fragment.  A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,419,446.  A modification of this system is described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,601,978.  See
also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982), describing expression of human .beta.-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus.  Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can
be used as the promoter.
<BR><BR> e) Enhancer Element Component
<BR><BR> Transcription of DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector.  Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin,
.alpha.-fetoprotein, and insulin).  Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus.  Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the human cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer,
the mouse cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.  See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982) describing enhancer elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. 
The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is generally located at a site 5' from the promoter.
<BR><BR> f) Transcription Termination Component
<BR><BR> Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA.  Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated
regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs.  These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody.  One useful transcription termination component is the bovine
growth hormone polyadenylation region.  See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.
<BR><BR> g) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells
<BR><BR> Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells.  Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine
procedure.  Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol.  36:59
(1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol.  Reprod.  23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1
ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75);
human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N.Y.  Acad.  Sci.  383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; CHOK1 cells, CHOK1SV cells or derivatives and a human hepatoma line (Hep
G2).
<BR><BR> Host cells are transformed with the above-described-expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the
genes encoding the desired sequences.
<BR><BR> h) Culturing the Host Cells
<BR><BR> The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media.  Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells.  In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., Meth.  Enz.  58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., Anal. Biochem.  102:255 (1980), U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762;
4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S.  Pat.  Re.  30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells.  Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin,
or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN.TM.  drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic
compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source.  Any other supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art.  The
culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
<BR><BR> i) Purification of Antibody
<BR><BR> When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium.  If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments,
may be removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration.  Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems may be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for
example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit.  A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.
<BR><BR> The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a convenient technique.  The
suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody.  Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human .gamma.1, .gamma.2, or .gamma.4 heavy
chains (Lindmark et al., J. Immunol.  Methods 62:1-13 (1983)).  Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human .gamma.3 (Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986)).  The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached may be agarose, but
other matrices are available.  Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose.  Where the antibody comprises a CH3
domain, the Bakerbond ABX.TM.  resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification.  Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on
silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE.TM.  chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be
recovered.
<BR><BR> Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to further purification, for example, by low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a
pH between about 2.5-4.5, performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).
<BR><BR> In general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing, and clinical use are well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art
for a particular antibody of interest.
<BR><BR> Production of Non-fucosylated Antibodies
<BR><BR> Provided herein are methods for preparing antibodies with a reduced degree of fucosylation.  For example, methods contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, use of cell lines deficient in protein fucosylation (e.g., Lec13 CHO cells,
alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene knockout CHO cells, cells overexpressing .beta.1,4-N-acetylglycosminyltransferase III and further overexpressing Golgi .mu.-mannosidase II, etc.), and addition of a fucose analog(s) in a cell culture medium used for the
production of the antibodies.  See Ripka et al. Arch.  Biochem.  Biophys.  249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; WO 2004/056312 A1; Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech.  Bioeng.  87: 614 (2004); and U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,574,907. 
Additional techniques for reducing the fucose content of antibodies include Glymaxx technology described in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0214975.  Additional techniques for reducing the fucose content of antibodies also include the
addition of one or more glycosidase inhibitors in a cell culture medium used for the production of the antibodies.  Glycosidase inhibitors include .alpha.-glucosidase I, .alpha.-glucosidase II, and .alpha.-mannosidase I. In some embodiments, the
glycosidase inhibitor is an inhibitor of .alpha.-mannosidase I (e.g., kifunensine).
<BR><BR> As used herein, "core fucosylation" refers to addition of fucose ("fucosylation") to N-acetylglucosamine ("GlcNAc") at the reducing terminal of an N-linked glycan.  Also provided are antibodies produced by such methods and compositions thereof.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, fucosylation of complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chains bound to the Fc region (or domain) is reduced.  As used herein, a "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" is typically bound to asparagine 297 (according to the number
of Kabat), although a complex N-glycoside linked sugar chain can also be linked to other asparagine residues.  A "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" excludes a high mannose type of sugar chain, in which only mannose is incorporated at the
non-reducing terminal of the core structure, but includes 1) a complex type, in which the non-reducing terminal side of the core structure has one or more branches of galactose-N-acetylglucosamine (also referred to as "gal-GlcNAc") and the non-reducing
terminal side of Gal-GlcNAc optionally has a sialic acid, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine or the like; or 2) a hybrid type, in which the non-reducing terminal side of the core structure has both branches of the high mannose N-glycoside-linked sugar chain
and complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" includes a complex type in which the non-reducing terminal side of the core structure has zero, one or more branches of galactose-N-acetylglucosamine (also referred to as
"gal-GlcNAc") and the non-reducing terminal side of Gal-GlcNAc optionally further has a structure such as a sialic acid, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine or the like.
<BR><BR> According to the present methods, typically only a minor amount of fucose is incorporated into the complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain(s).  For example, in various embodiments, less than about 60%, less than about 50%, less than about 40%,
less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less than about 1% of the antibody has core fucosylation by fucose in a composition.  In some embodiments, substantially none (i.e., less than
about 0.5%) of the antibody has core fucosylation by fucose in a composition.  In some embodiments, more than about 40%, more than about 50%, more than about 60%, more than about 70%, more than about 80%, more than about 90%, more than about 91%, more
than about 92%, more than about 93%, more than about 94%, more than about 95%, more than about 96%, more than about 97%, more than about 98%, or more than about 99% of the antibody is nonfucosylated in a composition.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, provided herein is an antibody wherein substantially none (i.e., less than about 0.5%) of the N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains contain a fucose residue.  In some embodiments, provided herein is an antibody wherein at
least one or two of the heavy chains of the antibody is non-fucosylated.
<BR><BR> As described above, a variety of mammalian host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express an antibody.  In some embodiments, the culture media is not supplemented with fucose.  In some embodiments, an effective amount of a fucose
analog is added to the culture media.  In this context, an "effective amount" refers to an amount of the analog that is sufficient to decrease fucose incorporation into a complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain of an antibody by at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40% or at least about 50%.  In some embodiments, antibodies produced by the instant methods comprise at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40% or at least about 50%
non-core fucosylated protein (e.g., lacking core fucosylation), as compared with antibodies produced from the host cells cultured in the absence of a fucose analog.
<BR><BR> The content (e.g., the ratio) of sugar chains in which fucose is not bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end of the sugar chain versus sugar chains in which fucose is bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end of the sugar chain
can be determined, for example, as described in the Examples.  Other methods include hydrazinolysis or enzyme digestion (see, e.g., Biochemical Experimentation Methods 23: Method for Studying Glycoprotein Sugar Chain (Japan Scientific Societies Press),
edited by Reiko Takahashi (1989)), fluorescence labeling or radioisotope labeling of the released sugar chain and then separating the labeled sugar chain by chromatography.  Also, the compositions of the released sugar chains can be determined by
analyzing the chains by the HPAEC-PAD method (see, e.g., J. Liq Chromatogr.  6:1557 (1983)).  (See generally U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0110282.).
<BR><BR> B. Compositions of the Invention
<BR><BR> In some aspects, also provided herein are compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) comprising any of the anti-Siglec-8 antibodies described herein (e.g., an antibody that binds to Siglec-8) or agonists described herein.  In some aspects,
provided herein is a composition comprising an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein, wherein the antibody comprises a Fc region and N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains linked to the Fc region, wherein less than about 50% of the N-glycoside-linked
carbohydrate chains contain a fucose residue.  In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a Fc region and N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains linked to the Fc region, wherein less than about 45%, about 40%, about 35%, about 30%, about 25%, about 20%,
or about 15% of the N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains contain a fucose residue.  In some aspects, provided herein is a composition comprising an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein, wherein the antibody comprises a Fc region and
N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains linked to the Fc region, wherein substantially none of the N-glycoside-linked carbohydrate chains contain a fucose residue.
<BR><BR> Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active ingredient having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,
20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wiklins, Pub., Gennaro Ed., Philadelphia, Pa.  2000).  Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers, antioxidants including
ascorbic acid, methionine, Vitamin E, sodium metabisulfite; preservatives, isotonicifiers, stabilizers, metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); chelating agents such as EDTA and/or non-ionic surfactants.
<BR><BR> Buffers can be used to control the pH in a range which optimizes the therapeutic effectiveness, especially if stability is pH dependent.  Buffers can be present at concentrations ranging from about 50 mM to about 250 mM.  Suitable buffering
agents for use with the present invention include both organic and inorganic acids and salts thereof.  For example, citrate, phosphate, succinate, tartrate, fumarate, gluconate, oxalate, lactate, acetate.  Additionally, buffers may be comprised of
histidine and trimethylamine salts such as Tris.
<BR><BR> Preservatives can be added to prevent microbial growth, and are typically present in a range from about 0.2%-1.0% (w/v).  Suitable preservatives for use with the present invention include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium
chloride; benzalkonium halides (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide), benzethonium chloride; thimerosal, phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol.
<BR><BR> Tonicity agents, sometimes known as "stabilizers" can be present to adjust or maintain the tonicity of liquid in a composition.  When used with large, charged biomolecules such as proteins and antibodies, they are often termed "stabilizers"
because they can interact with the charged groups of the amino acid side chains, thereby lessening the potential for inter and intra-molecular interactions.  Tonicity agents can be present in any amount between about 0.1% to about 25% by weight or
between about 1 to about 5% by weight, taking into account the relative amounts of the other ingredients.  In some embodiments, tonicity agents include polyhydric sugar alcohols, trihydric or higher sugar alcohols, such as glycerin, erythritol, arabitol,
xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol.
<BR><BR> Additional excipients include agents which can serve as one or more of the following: (1) bulking agents, (2) solubility enhancers, (3) stabilizers and (4) and agents preventing denaturation or adherence to the container wall.  Such excipients
include: polyhydric sugar alcohols (enumerated above); amino acids such as alanine, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, lysine, ornithine, leucine, 2-phenylalanine, glutamic acid, threonine, etc.; organic sugars or sugar alcohols such as
sucrose, lactose, lactitol, trehalose, stachyose, mannose, sorbose, xylose, ribose, ribitol, myoinisitose, myoinisitol, galactose, galactitol, glycerol, cyclitols (e.g., inositol), polyethylene glycol; sulfur containing reducing agents, such as urea,
glutathione, thioctic acid, sodium thioglycolate, thioglycerol, .alpha.-monothioglycerol and sodium thio sulfate; low molecular weight proteins such as human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, gelatin or other immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such
as polyvinylpyrrolidone; monosaccharides (e.g., xylose, mannose, fructose, glucose; disaccharides (e.g., lactose, maltose, sucrose); trisaccharides such as raffinose; and polysaccharides such as dextrin or dextran.
<BR><BR> Non-ionic surfactants or detergents (also known as "wetting agents") can be present to help solubilize the therapeutic agent as well as to protect the therapeutic protein against agitation-induced aggregation, which also permits the formulation

<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> Siglecs (sialic acid-binding, immunoglobulin-like lectins) are single-pass transmembrane cell surface proteins found predominantly on leukocytes.  Siglec-8, a member of the Siglec family, is expressed by human eosinophils, basophils, and mast
cells.  Siglec-8 recognizes a sulfated glycan, i.e., 6'-sulfo-sialyl Lewis X or 6'-sulfo-sialyl-N-acetyl-S-lactosamine, and contains an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain shown to inhibit mast cell function.

<BR><BR>Activity of Anti-Siglec-8 Antibodies on Eosinophils Found in Nasal Polyps and Blood Samples from CRSwNP Patients
<BR><BR> The activity of humanized antibodies anti-Siglec-8 antibodies against eosinophils found in nasal polyps and blood samples isolated from patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) was investigated.
<BR><BR> Materials and Methods
<BR><BR> Nasal polyp tissue isolated from patients with CRSwNP was minced into approximately 3 millimeter pieces in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the suspension was transferred to 50 mL conical tube.  After removal of the supernatant, tissues were
dissociated using RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 10 .mu.g/mL collagenase IV, 0.5 mg/mL Hyaluronidase type I-S, 5 mM MgSO.sub.4, 1 mg/mL DNAse with agitation at 37.degree.  C. for 1 hour.  The cell suspension was
filtered through a 40 .mu.m filter and red blood cells (RBC) were removed by incubation for 5 minutes at room temperature using ammonium chloride lysis buffer (0.8% NH.sub.4Cl, 10 mM KHCO.sub.3, and 0.1 mM EDTA solution in water).  The cells were washed
twice with PBS and subsequently used in flow cytometry and cell depletion assays.
<BR><BR> For flow cytometry assays, cells in the nasal polyp cell suspension were stained for cell-surface markers using anti-Siglec-8 antibody (R&D Systems antibody Clone 837535), anti-IgE Receptor antibody (anti-IgER), anti-CCR3 antibody, and anti-CD45
antibody.  The cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur.TM.  instrument (BD Biosciences).  Eosinophils were identified based on the CD45.sup.+CCR3.sup.+IgER.sup.- cell population.  Mast cells were defined by the
CD45.sup.+CCR3.sup.-IgER.sup.+ cell population.
<BR><BR> For cell-depletion assays, 1.0.times.10.sup.6 nasal polyp cells suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were incubated for 16 hours with 10 .mu.g/mL HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody, HEKA IgG1 non-fucosylated
humanized antibody or human IgG4 isotype control antibody.  The cells were washed twice with PBS and stained for flow cytometry assays as described above using murine anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody (clone 1H10), anti-IgER antibody, anti-CCR3 antibody,
and anti-CD45 antibody.  Eosinophils were gated based on the CD45.sup.+CCR3.sup.+IgER.sup.- cell population.
<BR><BR> Blood from healthy donors and from patients with CRSwNP was collected and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were isolated less than 24 hours after harvest (Table 6).  Cells were suspended in complete RPMI medium [(RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen,
Catalog Number A10491-01) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum)]. Cells were adjusted to 107 cells per mL in Complete RPMI medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-5 (R&D Systems, Catalog Number 205-IL-025) or without added cytokine,
and plated at 100 .mu.L per well in a sterile 96-well U-bottom plate.  Anti-Siglec-8 antibodies were added at concentrations ranging from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 .mu.g/mL (i.e., 1 pg/mL, 10 pg/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 0.1 .mu.g/mL, 1 .mu.g/mL, and 10
.mu.g/mL) to determine the dose response and concentration providing 50% maximal eosinophil depletion (EC50).  Plates were centrifuged at 200 g for 1 minute and incubated in a humidified 37.degree.  C. incubator at 5% C02 for 16 hours.  The cell
populations were evaluated by flow cytometry to assess depletion of eosinophils.  Eosinophil depletion was detected by the removal of CCR3-positive granular (high side-scatter) cells.

<BR><BR> Results
<BR><BR> A high level of mast cells (8% of total isolated cells) were detected in nasal polyp homogenate.  CRSwNP patients express high levels of Siglec-8 on eosinophils in blood (6 out of 6 samples; not shown) and nasal polyp (2 out of 2 samples; one
example shown in FIG. 1).
<BR><BR> Anti-Siglec-8 antibodies have been described that induce apoptosis in eosinophils activated with various cytokines (including IL-5, GM-CSF or IL-33).  In contrast to the potent induction of apoptosis in IL-5-treated eosinophils, anti-Siglec-8
antibodies, including HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody, showed only modest eosinophil-depleting activity in peripheral blood leukocyte preparations from normal donors in the absence of added cytokines (FIG. 3).  In contrast, HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody
killed eosinophils from nasal polyp cell homogenate with or without IL-5 (FIG. 2).  Unlike in non-diseased blood samples, where activation of eosinophils with IL-5 improves killing, in diseased tissue HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody did not require
incubation with IL-5.  Without being bound by theory, this may indicate that the tissue eosinophils were already sensitized to the pro-apoptotic effect of anti-Siglec-8 antibody.
<BR><BR> Due to potent ADCC effect, HEKA IgG1 non-fucosylated humanized antibody showed more significant killing of eosinophils in healthy donor blood samples as compared to HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody (FIG. 3).  In the nasal polyp cell homogenate,
activities of HEKA IgG1 non-fucosylated humanized antibody and HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody were similar, indicating that ADCC was not required for the cell-killing activity of HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody on polyp-derived eosinophils.  In healthy donor
blood samples, HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody preferentially killed IL-5 activated eosinophils (FIG. 3).  Only modest cell-killing activity of HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody was observed in normal blood samples incubated without IL-5.  HEKA IgG1
non-fucosylated humanized antibody induced potent ADCC effect on all (resting and activated) eosinophils.  Robust NK cell activity was demonstrated in all normal blood samples (FIG. 3).
<BR><BR> Unlike in normal blood, NK cell based ADCC activity was impaired in CRSwNP patients (FIG. 4).  In 5 out of 6 CRSwNP patient blood samples, the activity of HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody and HEKA IgG1 non-fucosylated humanized antibody on depleting
blood eosinophils was similar, indicating that there was no additional enhancement of killing activity due to ADCC in these patient-derived samples.  In all five samples with impaired ADCC activity, the number of CD16.sup.+NK cells was in the normal
range (from 4.2 to 9.9%) indicating that the activity of NK cells in CRSwNP patients may be impaired.
<BR><BR> These results indicate that HEKA IgG4 humanized antibody showed potent and selective cell-depleting activity against tissue eosinophils and circulating eosinophils from patients suffering from CRSwNP.  The antibody had activity against
eosinophils from patients in whom normal NK-cell function required for ADCC-mediated killing was impaired.
<BR><BR> Individuals with CRSwNP and concomitant asthma are difficult to treat.  It has been shown that removal of nasal polyps improves asthma control in these individuals.  See Ehnhage et al., Allergy., 64:762-769, 2009.  Treatment with an
eosinophil-depleting antibody to reduce the size of nasal polyps in order to improve asthma symptoms would be beneficial in these individuals.  IL-5 has been implicated in diseases that are mediated by eosinophils such as asthma.  Benralizumab is a
monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-5 receptor, demonstrates eosinophil-depleting activity via NK cell-mediated ADCC activity and is used to treat asthma.  See Ghazi et al., Expert Opin Biol Ther., 12(1):113-118, 2012.  However, antibodies such as
Benralizumab that rely on NK cells to mediate ADCC activity for depleting eosinophils may not be the best course of treatment for diseases associated with impaired NK cell function.
<BR><BR> The anti-Siglec-8 antibodies described herein may be more effective as compared to antibodies that require functional NK cells to deplete eosinophils since the anti-Siglec-8 antibodies described herein have been shown to deplete eosinophils
without the need of NK cells.  In particular, treatment with an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein is particularly advantageous for the treatment of asthma symptoms in individuals with CRSwNP because such individuals typically have impaired NK cell
function and are not able to respond to antibodies that require NK cell function for their activity.
