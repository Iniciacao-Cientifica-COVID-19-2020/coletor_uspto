<BR><BR>This application claims the benefit of U.S.  Provisional Application No. 60/016,536, filed May 7, 1996, and U.S.  Provisional Application No. 60/016,987, filed May 7, 1996.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to processes for the manufacture of single enantiomer and enantiomerically-enriched forms of verapamil precursors, and their use in the manufacture of verapamil.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Verapamil (1, below) is presently in clinical use as the racemate and is used extensively for the treatment of hypertension.  The (S)-enantiomer (levoverapamil) has the majority of the calcium channel antagonist activity (see DE-A-2059923),
whilst the (R)-enantiomer (dextroverapamil) differs in having sodium channel and other cell-pump actions in addition to higher bioavailability, with slower clearance rate.  Therefore, single isomer products may have clinical utility.  For example, the
(R)-enantiomer may be of benefit for the treatment of multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy (see Eliason, Int.  J. Cancer (1990) 46: 113).  ##STR1##
<BR><BR>There is, therefore, a requirement for efficient processes to manufacture enantiomerically-enriched forms of verapamil and its analogues.  This is a challenging endeavour since construction of the quaternary chiral centre with high asymmetric
induction is difficult.  Several synthetic routes have been published, but for a variety of reasons these are not suitable for operation on a large scale.
<BR><BR>For example, Theodore and Nelson, J. Org. Chem. (1987) 52:1309, describe a synthesis of (S)-verapamil commencing from (S)-1,2-propanediol which entails eleven steps, only three of which are used to create permanent skeletal bonds.  Of the shorter
routes proceeding via classical resolution, a process reported in WO-A-9509150, involving resolution of the secondary amine intermediate and subsequent conversion to single enantiomer verapamil, is advantageous over resolution or verapamil itself, which
is described in DE-A-3723684 and WO-A-9316035, due to better atom utilisation and lower waste levels.
<BR><BR>Alternatively, resolution of a racemic acid precursor would appear to provide an attractive route.  Indeed, resolution of 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (verapamilic acid 2, below) has already been reported in DE-A-2059923
using brucine, together with elaboration to enantiomerically-enriched verapamil.  However, there is doubt as to whether this resolution process is reproducible.  In addition, brucine is highly toxic, and thus unsuitable for a large-scale manufacturing
process.  ##STR2##
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>According to a first aspect of the present invention, a process for preparing a substantially single enantiomer (R or S) of 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-hexanoic acid, or an analogue thereof, proceeds by means of a classical salt
resolution employing an enantiomer (R or S) of an industrially-acceptable resolving agent that is a 1-arylalkylamine or (-)-quinine.  The product obtained from the resolution can then, if desired, be converted to single enantiomer verapamil by standard
chemical techniques.
<BR><BR>The resolving agents for use in the present invention are more industrially-acceptable than the formerly used brucine.  In particular, they are relatively non-toxic as compared to brucine, and tend not to require special handling techniques. 
They are, therefore, suitable for large-scale, i.e. multi-tonne, manufacture.  Further, such resolving agents are available in large quantities at reasonable cost, which is again advantageous for large-scale manufacture, and are robust enough to
withstand recycling and several passes through the resolution process.
<BR><BR>In addition, the doubtful reproducibility of the brucine resolution means that access to a substantially single enantiomer (R or S) of 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid is reliant on the process of the present invention.  The
substantially single enantiomer form of the acid is thus enabled for the first time.
<BR><BR>According to a second aspect of the present invention, novel salts of 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-hexanoic acid, or an analogue thereof, are provided.
<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Preferred 1-arylalkylamines include those in which the aryl group has 6 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. naphthyl or phenyl.  More preferred are the 1-arylethylamines, with 1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine and 1-phenylethylamine (otherwise known as
.alpha.-methylbenzylamine) being particularly preferred.
<BR><BR>The resolution procedure is extremely simple.  For example, a quantity of racemic 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid and a quantity of resolving agent are suspended in a suitable solvent, warmed, e.g. to about 40.degree.  C.,
and then cooled, e.g. to about 15.degree.  C., whereupon a crystalline solid, i.e. a salt, forms.  This crystalline material will be enriched in either (R) or (S)-4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, depending on which resolving agent
or which enantiomer of resolving agent is used.  For instance, the use of (R) or (5)-1-(1-naphthyl) ethylamine or (R) or (S)-1-phenylethylamine gives rise to crystalline material, i.e. a salt, that is similarly enriched, i.e. in the (R) or
(S)-enantiomer, respectively.  Whereas treatment with (-)-quinine results in a crystalline material enriched in (S)-4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid.  Liberation of the free acid from the salt and recovery of the resolving agent is
facilitated through standard pH adjustment and solvent extractions.
<BR><BR>The process of the present invention is capable of achieving substantially single enantiomer 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid.  By substantially single enantiomer typically we mean an enantiomeric excess of at least 50%, more
typically at least 70%, and preferably higher, e.g. at least 80% or 90% ee.  The enantiomeric excess of the product can be increased by standard recrystallisation techniques.
<BR><BR>The free acid obtained by the resolution can be readily converted to verapamil, or an analogue thereof, by standard chemical techniques, for instance as described in DE-A-2059923, or more advantageously as described in British Patent Application
no. 9618835.4. <BR><BR>The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.  "The acid" is 4-cyano-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>The acid (2.91 g, 1.0 mmol) was taken up in 12 ml of ethanol by heating to 40.degree.  C. To this stirred solution was added (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (1.71 g; 1.0 mmol) in one portion via syringe.  Stirring at 40.degree.  C. was continued for
5 minutes, the solution was then cooled to 15.degree.  C. and maintained at this temperature for 16 hours.  A seed was added after 5 minutes stirring at 15.degree.  C. The crystals that formed were collected by filtration to give 1.10 g of a white solid,
which was enriched in the (R)-enantiomer of the acid (98.3% ee as determined by chiral HPLC after salt cracking).  The salt was recrystallised to diastereomeric purity with ethyl acetate.
<BR><BR>The mother liquors from the filtration were evaporated under reduced pressure to give 3.51 g of a beige coloured solid, which was enriched with the (S)-enantiomer of the acid (50% ee).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>This resolution was carried out according to the procedure of Example 1, except that ethyl acetate was the solvent employed.
<BR><BR>The acid (1.70 g; 5.83 mmol) and (S)-1-(1-naphthyl)-ethylamine (1.00 g; 5.83 mmol) were taken up in 12 ml of ethyl acetate.  After overnight stirring at 15.degree.  C. a precipitate had formed.  This was collected by filtration to give 1.29 g of
a white solid, which was enriched in the (S)-enantiomer of the acid (70.3% ee) This was recrystallised to diastereomeric purity with ethyl acetate, The mother liquors after solvent removal gave 1.40 g of a beige-coloured solid, which was enriched in the
(R)-enantiomer of the acid (75% ee).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>This resolution was carried out using the procedure of Example 1, except that ethyl acetate was the solvent employed.
<BR><BR>The acid (0.291 g; 1.00 mmol) and (5)-1-phenylethylamine (0.121 g; 1.00 mmol) were taken up in 2 ml of ethyl acetate.  The mixture was seeded after stirring at room temperature for 5 minutes.  After stirring overnight at .about.10.degree.  C., a
precipitate had formed.  This was collected by filtration to give 0.119 g of a white solid, which was enriched in the (S)-enantiomer of the acid (95% ee).
<BR><BR>The mother liquors after solvent removal gave 0.290 g of a beige-coloured foam, which was enriched in the (R)-enantiomer of the acid (42.6% ee).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 4
<BR><BR>This resolution was carried out using the procedure of Example 1, except that isopropanol was the solvent employed.
<BR><BR>The acid (0.291 g; 1.00 mmol) and (S)-1-phenylethylamine (0.121 g; 1.00 mmol) were taken up in 2 ml of isopropanol.  The mixture was seeded after stirring at room temperature for 5 minutes.  After stirring overnight at .about.100.degree.  C. a
precipitate had formed.  This was collected by filtration to give 0.124 g of a white solid, which was enriched in the (S)-enantiomer of the acid (85.91 ee).
<BR><BR>The mother liquors after solvent removal gave 0.285 g of a beige-coloured foam, which was enriched in the (R)-enantiomer of the acid (44.61 ea).
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 5
<BR><BR>The acid (2.91 g; 1.0 mmol) and (-)-quinine (3.24 g; 1.0 mmol) were taken up in 20 ml of acetone by heating to 40.degree.  C. Stirring at 40.degree.  C. was continued for 5 minutes, and the solution was then cooled to 15.degree.  C. and
maintained at this temperature for 16 hours.  A seed crystal was added after 5 minutes' stirring at 15.degree.  C. The crystals that formed were collected by filtration to give 1.90 g of a white solid, which was enriched in the (S)-enantiomer of the acid
(75.2% ee).  Two recrystallisations in acetone resulted in a diastereomeric purity of 92%.
<BR><BR>The mother liquors from the filtration were evaporated under reduced pressure to give 4.25 g of a beige-coloured solid, which was enriched with the (R)-enantiomer of the acid (43% ee),
