<BR><BR> Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 are a sub-class of the class of drugs known as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  The NSAIDs are active in reducing the prostaglandin-induced pain and swelling associated with the
inflammation process but are also active in affecting other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with the inflammation process.  Thus, use of high doses of most common NSAIDs can produce severe side effects, including life threatening ulcers,
that limit their therapeutic potential.  An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteroids, which have even more drastic side effects, especially when long term therapy is involved.
<BR><BR> Previous NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandin by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).  The discovery that there are two isoforms of the COX
enzyme, the first, COX-1, being involved with physiological functions and the second, COX-2, being induced in inflamed tissue, has given rise to a new approach.  While conventional NSAIDs block both forms of the enzyme, the identification of the
inducible COX-2 enzyme associated with inflammation has provided a viable target of inhibition which more effectively reduces inflammation and produces fewer and less drastic side effects.  Many compounds which have activity as COX-2 inhibitors have been
identified, including rofecoxib (VIOXX.RTM.), etoricoxib (ARCOXMA.TM.), celecoxib (CELEBREX.RTM.) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA.TM.), and much research continues in this area.
<BR><BR> Many patients suffering from a chronic cyclooxygenase-2 mediated disease or condition are elderly and thus are at increased risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events, such as stroke, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris,
transient ischemic attack (TIA; amaurosis fugax), reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and any similar thrombotic event in any vascular bed (splanchnic, renal, aortic, peripheral, etc.).  Moreover, there is evidence that patients with chronic
inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis are at increased risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events.  It is desirable that such patients receive appropriate therapy to reduce their risk of such events, such
as low-dose aspirin therapy.  However, it has been reported that the co-administration of aspirin and a selective COX-2 inhibitor in a rat model resulted in substantially more severe gastric injury than is produced with either agent alone.  See Fiorucci
et al., Gastroenterology, vol. 123, pp.  1598-1606, 2002.  Thus, the major advantage that COX-2 selective inhibitors have over NSAIDS may be offset by the concomitant use of aspirin.
<BR><BR> NO-releasing forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known in the art and are reported to have improved gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety profiles over their conventional NSAID counterparts.  Furthermore, NO-releasing forms
of selective cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are disclosed in WO 01/45703, published on Jun.  28, 2001.
<BR><BR> The present invention provides for novel nitrosated prodrugs for cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors that are useful for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases or conditions and can be administered alone or in combination with low-dose
aspirin.  The invention provides efficacy in treating chronic cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases or conditions, effectively reduces the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events and potentially renal side effects and at the same time reduces the risk of
GI ulceration or bleeding.

<BR><BR> The term "sequentially administering" means administering the agents at separately staggered times.  Thus, agents can be sequentially administered such that the beneficial pharmaceutical effect of aspirin and a compound of the present invention
are realized by the patient at substantially the same time.  Thus, for example, if a compound of the present invention and aspirin are both administered on a once a day basis, the interval of separation between sequential administration of the two agents
can be up to twelve hours apart.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other
therapeutic ingredients.  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" include salts prepared from bases that result in non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including inorganic bases and organic bases.  Salts derived from inorganic bases include

<BR><BR> The compounds of Formula I are prodrugs of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors which covert in vivo to diaryl-2-(5H)-furanones.  The compounds also liberate nitric oxide in vivo, which is believed to contribute to an improved gastrointestinal
and potentially renal safety profile.  As such, the compounds of the present invention may be co-dosed with low-dose aspirin to treat chronic cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases or conditions, effectively reduce the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular
events and potentially renal side effects and at the same time reduce the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.  Thus, patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as well as potentially patients with renal insufficiency, would actively benefit
from being administered compounds of the present invention over NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors currently available.
<BR><BR> By virtue of the cyclooxygenase-2 activity of the active moiety of the prodrugs of the present invention, the compounds of Formula I are therefore useful for the relief of pain, fever and inflammation of a variety of conditions including
rheumatic fever, symptoms associated with influenza or other viral infections, common cold, low back and neck pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine (acute and prophylactics treatment), toothache, sprains and strains, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis,
arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative joint diseases (osteoarthritis), gout and ankylosing spondylitis, acute, subacute and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes such as bursitis, burns, injuries, and pain following surgical and dental
procedures as well as the preemptive treatment of surgical pain.  In addition, such a compound may inhibit cellular neoplastic transformations and metastic tumor growth and hence can be used in the treatment of cancer.  Compounds of Formula I may also be
useful for the treatment or prevention of endometriosis, and Parkinson's disease.
<BR><BR> Compounds of Formula I will also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction by preventing the synthesis of contractile prostanoids and hence may be of use in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, premature labor and asthma.
<BR><BR> By virtue of the high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and/or the selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) of the active moiety of the prodrugs of the invention as defined above, compounds of Formula I will prove useful as
an alternative to conventional non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID'S) particularly where such non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be contra-indicated such as in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis,
diverticulitis or with a recurrent-history of gastrointestinal lesions; GI bleeding, coagulation disorders including anemia such as hypoprothrombinemia, haemophilia or other bleeding problems (including those relating to reduced or impaired platelet
function); kidney disease (e.g. impaired renal function); those prior to surgery or taking anticoagulants; and those susceptible to NSAID induced asthma.
<BR><BR> Similarly, compounds of Formula I will be useful as a partial or complete substitute for conventional NSAIDs in preparations wherein they are presently co-administered with other agents or ingredients.  Thus in further aspects, the invention
encompasses pharmaceutical compositions for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as defined above comprising a non-toxic therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I as defined above and one or more ingredients such as another
pain reliever including acetominophen or phenacetin; opioid analgesics, such as codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphine, propoxyphene, buprenorphine, butorphanol, dezocine, nalbuphine and

diseases comprising: administration to a patient in need of such treatment a non-toxic therapeutically effect amount of the compound of Formula I, optionally co-administered with one or more of such ingredients as listed immediately above.
<BR><BR> Compounds of the present invention are prodrugs of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and are thereby useful in the treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as enumerated above.  This activity is illustrated by their ability to selectively
inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1.  Accordingly, the ability of the compounds of this invention to convert to the active compound and thus treat cyclooxygenase mediated diseases can be demonstrated by measuring the amount of prostaglandin
E.sub.2 (PGE.sub.2) synthesized in the presence of arachidonic acid, cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 and a compound of Formula I as illustrated in the assays that follow.  The IC.sub.50 values represent the concentration of inhibitor required to
return PGE.sub.2 synthesis to 50% of that obtained as compared to the uninhibited control.  For the treatment of any of these cyclooxygenase mediated diseases, compounds of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation
spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.  Compounds of the invention may be administered via the buccal or sublingual mucosa in the oral cavity.  The
term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.  Compounds of the invention may also be administered through the nasal, pulmonary (inhalation aerosol) or ocular
route.  In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.
<BR><BR> As indicated above, pharmaceutical compositions for treating cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as defined may optionally include one or more ingredients as listed above.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules,
or syrups or elixirs.  Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting
of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.  Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable

example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.  The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay
disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.  For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.  They may also be coated by
the technique described in the U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.
<BR><BR> Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the
active ingredients is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.
<BR><BR> Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.  Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, methyl cellulose,
hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty
acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids
and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate.  The aqueous suspensions may also
contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.
<BR><BR> Liquid formulations include the use of self-emulsifying drug delivery systems and NanoCrystal.RTM.  technology.  Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes can also be utilized.
<BR><BR> Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin.  The oily suspensions may contain a thickening
agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol.  Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation.  These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an
anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.
<BR><BR> Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.  Suitable
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.  Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.
<BR><BR> The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions.  The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of
these.  Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the
said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.  The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.
<BR><BR> Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose.  Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.  The pharmaceutical
compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension.  This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned
above.  The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol.  Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that
may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.  In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.  For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic
mono- or diglycerides.  In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
<BR><BR> Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug.  These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug.  Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.
<BR><BR> For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed.  (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also utilize absorption enhancers such as tween 80, tween 20, Vitamin E TPGS (d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) and Gelucire.RTM..
<BR><BR> Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.01 mg to about 140 mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day.  For example, inflammation
may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 g per patient per day, preferably 2.5 mg to 1 g per patient per day.
<BR><BR> The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.  For example, a formulation intended for the
oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition.  Dosage unit forms will
generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.
<BR><BR> It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of
excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

<BR><BR> The compound of Formula I can be tested using the following assays to determine their biological activity.
<BR><BR> Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase Activity
<BR><BR> Compounds are tested as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity in whole cell and microsomal cyclooxygenase assays.  Both of these assays measure prostaglandin E.sub.2 (PGE.sub.2) synthesis in response to arachidonic acid, using a
radioimmunoassay.  Cells used for whole cell assays, and from which microsomes are prepared for microsomal assays, are human osteosarcoma 143 cells (which specifically express cyclooxygenase-2) and human U-937 cells (which specifically express
cyclooxygenase-1).  In these assays, 100% activity is defined as the difference between prostaglandin E.sub.2 synthesis in the absence and presence of arachidonate addition.  IC.sub.50 values represent the concentration of putative inhibitor required to
return PGE.sub.2 synthesis to 50% of that obtained as compared to the uninhibited control.
<BR><BR> A. Microsomal Cyclooxygenase Assay
<BR><BR> Cox microsomal fractions are prepared as previously described (Percival et al., Arch.  Biochem.  Biophys.  (1994) 315:111-118).  The enzyme reactions are performed in 50 mM KPi pH 8.0, 1 .mu.M heme, 1 mM phenol supplemented with 10 .mu.g/ml of
each Cox-1 or Cox-2 microsomal fractions.  1 .mu.l DMSO or test compound (100 fold stock concentrated in DMSO) are added to 100 .mu.l buffer.  The enzyme reaction is initiated 15 minutes later by the addition of 10 .mu.l of 100 .mu.M arachidonic acid. 
The enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature before being stopped by the addition of 10 .mu.l 1 N HCl.  PGE.sub.2 levels are then determined by EIA (Assay Designs) using the manufacturer's instruction.
<BR><BR> This assay may be used to demonstrate that the unconverted prodrugs of the instant invention are inactive against both COX-1 and COX-2.
<BR><BR> B. Human Whole Blood Cyclooxygenase Assay
<BR><BR> Rationale
<BR><BR> Whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs.  To study the inhibitory activities of these compounds on the two isoforms of
cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), human blood is either stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours to induce COX-2 or the blood is allowed to clot spontaneously to activate COX-1.  The production of prostaglandin E.sub.2 (PGE.sub.2) and
thromboxane B.sub.2 (TXB.sub.2) are measured by immunoassay at the end of the incubation as readouts of COX-2 and COX-1 activity, respectively.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Human whole blood assays for COX-1 and COX-2 activity, previously reported (Brideau et al, 1996) are performed as described below.
<BR><BR> 1.  COX-2 (LPS-Induced PGE.sub.2 Production):
<BR><BR> Fresh blood is collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from healthy male volunteers.  These subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.  The blood is
initially pre-incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 100 g/1 ml (Sigma Chem, #L-2630 from E. coli, serotype 0111:B4; diluted in 0.1% w/v bovine serine albumin in phosphate buffered saline).  Five minutes later, 500 .mu.L aliquots of the
LPS-treated blood aree incubated with 2 .mu.L vehicle (DMSO) or 2 .mu.L of test compounds in DMSO for 24 hr at 37.degree.  C. (for induction of COX-2).  Unstimulated control blood at time zero (no LPS) is used as blank.  At the end of the 24 hr
incubation, the blood is centrifuged at 3,000 rpms for 10 min at 40.degree.  C. to obtain plasma.  The plasma is assayed for PGE.sub.2 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, 901-001) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
<BR><BR> 2.  COX-1 (Clotting-Induced TXB2 Production):
<BR><BR> Fresh blood from male or female volunteers is collected into vacutainers containing no anticoagulants.  These subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection. 
Aliquots of 500 L are immediately transferred to polypropylene tubes preloaded with 2 .mu.L of DMSO or 2 .mu.L of test compounds.  The tubes are vortexed and incubated at 37.degree.  C. for 1 h to allow the blood to clot.  At the end of the incubation,
serum is obtained by centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 10 min at 40.degree.  C.).  The serum is obtained and is assayed for TXB.sub.2 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, 901-002) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

<BR><BR> The carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay is an established assay for evaluating the efficacy of conventional, non-selective NSAIDs in acute inflammation (Winter and Flataker, 1965; Mukheijee et al., 1996; Vinegar et al., 1987).
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) are fasted for 16-18 h prior to oral administration of either the vehicle (0.5% methocel) or test compound.  One hour later, a line was drawn using a permanent marker at a level above the ankle in one hind
paw to define the area of the paw to be monitored.  The paw volume (V.sub.0) is measured using a plethysmometer (Ugo-Basile, Italy) based on the Archimedes principle of water displacement.  The rats are then injected subplantarly with 0.05 mL of a 1%
carrageenan (Sigma Chem.) solution in saline using a syringe with a 27-gauge needle (i.e. 500 .mu.g carrageenan per paw).  Three hours later, the paw volume (V.sub.3) is measured again and the increases in paw volume (V.sub.3-V.sub.0) is calculated.  Paw
edema is compared with the vehicle-control group and the percent inhibition calculated taking the values in the control group as 0%.
<BR><BR> NSAID-Induced Gastropathy in Rats
<BR><BR> Rationale
<BR><BR> The major side effect of conventional NSAIDs is their ability to produce gastric lesions in man.  Rats are sensitive to the actions of NSAIDs and have been used commonly in the past to evaluate the gastrointestinal side effects of current
conventional NSAIDs.  In the present assay, NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage is observed by measuring urinary .sup.51Cr excretion after oral dosing of 5.sup.1Cr-EDTA.  Urinary 5.sup.1Cr excretion is a well-established and sensitive technique to
detect gastrointestinal integrity in animals and man.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) are administered orally a test compound either once (acute dosing) or in multiple doses for a few days (chronic dosing).  Immediately after the administration of the last dose, the rats are given an oral dose
of .sup.51Cr-EDTA (10 .mu.Ci/rat).  The animals are placed individually in metabolism cages with food and water ad lib.  Urine is collected for a 24 hr period and .sup.51Cr urinary excretion is calculated as a percent of total ingested dose.
<BR><BR> Protein-Losing Gastrophathy in Squirrel Monkeys
<BR><BR> Rationale
<BR><BR> Protein-losing gastropathy (manifested as appearance of circulating cells and plasma proteins in the GI tract) is a significant and dose-limiting adverse response to NSAIDs.  This can be quantitatively assessed by intravenous administration or
.sup.51CrCl.sub.3 solution.  This isotopic ion can avidly bind to cell and serum globins and cell endoplasmic reticulum.  Measurement of radioactivity appearing in feces collected for 24 hr after administration of the isotope thus provides a sensitive
and quantitative index of protein-losing gastropathy.
<BR><BR> Methods
<BR><BR> Groups of male squirrel monkeys (0.8 to 1.4 kg) are treated by gavage with 1% methocel or a test compounds at multiple doses for a few days.  Intravenous .sup.51Cr (5 .mu.Ci/kg in 1 ml/kg PBS) is administered 1 hr after the last drug/vehicle
dose, and feces collected for 24 hr in a metabolism cage and assessed for excreted .sup.51Cr by gamma-counting.  .sup.51Cr fecal excretion is calculated as a percent of total injected dose.
<BR><BR> Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Rings in Male Spargue-Dawley Rats
<BR><BR> Preparation of Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Rings Male Sprague-Dawley Rats (Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) are euthanized by intraperiton injection of a high dose of sodium pentobarbitone (80-100 mg/kg).  The thoracic aorta is
rapidly excised and immediately placed in a Petri dish containing warm (37.degree.  C.) oxygenated (95% 0, and 5% C02) Kreb's buffer (composition per millimolar: NaCl (119); KCl (4.69); CaCl.sub.2.H.sub.2O (2.52); MgSO.sub.4.7H.sub.2O (0.57);
NaHCO.sub.2, (25); NaH2PO.,.H.sub.2O (1.01) and glucose (11.1).  Under a stereoscopic dissecting microscope, the aorta is cleaned, freed from adhering fat and connective tissues.  The tissue is cut into ring segments, each approximately 2-3 mm in length.
<BR><BR> For experiments to measure relaxation of the tissue under various conditions, a stainless steel tissue holder and an U-shaped stainless steel wire are inserted into the lumen of the aortic ring.  The tissue holder anchored the ring at the bottom
of the organ bath whereas the end of the U-shaped steel wire is tied with fine silk thread so that it connected to the Fr-202 transducer.  The tissue holder and the steel wire along with the aortic ring are then suspended in a 5-ml, double-jacketed
temperature-controlled glass organ bath (Radnoti Glass Technology, Inc., Monrovia, Calif.) filled with fresh Kreb's buffer.  A mixture of 95% O.sub.2 and 5% CO.sub.2 is bubbled through a porous sintered disc at the bottom of the bath.  The rings are
given an initial resting tension of 1.5 g and the preparation is allowed to equilibrate at the initial tension for about 90 minutes.  During this equilibration period, the bath fluid is changed every 15 minutes and replaced with fresh prewarmed
(37.degree.  C.) Kreb's buffer.  The isometric tension of the aortic muscle at rest and its response to different stimuli are recorded on a Power Macintosh 6100 computer via a MacLab 8/S computer interface (CB Sciences, Inc, Milford, Mass.) after an
initial amplification through a low-noise EM-400 bioamplifier (CB Sciences, Inc, Milford, Mass.).  Contractile responsiveness of the tissue strips is established with 10 TM phenylephrine, and the strips are incubated with the drug for 20 minutes to
establish a steady level of contraction.
<BR><BR> To test the relaxation effects, test compounds can be added to the phenylephrine precontracted strips in the tissue bath at cumulative concentrations of 0.1 .mu.M to 0.1 mM.  Concentration of test compounds may be increased only after relaxation
at the previous concentration had reached a plateau level.
<BR><BR> Gastric Erosion Model in Rats
<BR><BR> The gastric protective effects of the combination of the present invention co-administered with aspirin may be evaluated in the following assay.
<BR><BR> Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were fasted for 16-18 h prior to use for experiment.  Aspirin, rofecoxib in combination with aspirin (dosed separately), or test compound in combination with aspirin (dosed separately) were given on the morning of
the experiment at a dosing volume of 1 ml/kg in 0.5% methocel.  Three hr later, the animals were euthanized by CO.sub.2 inhalation and the stomach removed, rinsed in saline and prepared for imaging processing.  Microscopic pictures of the stomach were
taken using a digital camera and gastric erosions were measured using an imaging software by an observer unaware of the treatment groups.  The length of gastric erosions was measured in mm and the total length of all erosions from each stomach was
obtained and used as gastric damage score.
