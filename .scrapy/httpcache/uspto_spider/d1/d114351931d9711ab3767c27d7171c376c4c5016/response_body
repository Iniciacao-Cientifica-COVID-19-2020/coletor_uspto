hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and the like.  The term,
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" also refers to the compounds that can be combined with free chloroquine base (e.g. phosphate and diphosphate).
<BR><BR> In the event that embodiments of the disclosed agents form salts, these salts are within the scope of the present disclosure.  Reference to an agent of any of the formulas herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless
otherwise indicated.  The term "salt(s)", as employed herein, denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases.  In addition, when an agent contains both a basic moiety and an acidic moiety, zwitterions ("inner

<BR><BR>Compounds of the Invention
<BR><BR> The formula for R-chloroquine and the process of synthesis of R-chloroquine is described in FIG. 1.  Alternatively, R-chloroquine is commercially available and can be purchased from Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI.TM.); (catalog
number, CHEBI: 48811).
<BR><BR> The structures of clemizole and the major human (M1, M6) and rodent (M12, M14) clemizole metabolites are shown in FIG. 2.  Clemizole hydrochloride is commercially available from APExBIO.TM.  (Catalog No. A3316).
<BR><BR> In human liver, clemizole is primarily converted to an intermediate A, which several CYP450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6) can oxidize to M1.  In the presence of CYP2C9 or CYP1A2, M2 is generated, but they cannot produce M1.  Cyp2C9 appears
to be the only source of M4, which is a minor metabolite in humans.  CYP3A4, which is the most abundantly expressed CYP450 enzyme in human liver, mediates the majority of this drug biotransformation reaction.  The ability of ritonavir, which is an
inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to inhibit clemizole metabolism in vitro suggested that CYP3A4 plays a major role in clemizole metabolism in humans.  In contrast, a different type (CYP2C-like) of aromatic oxidation reaction produces the rodent-predominant
metabolites (M12, M14 and M15), through the dominant pathway for clemizole metabolism in rodent liver.
<BR><BR>Synthesis of Clemizole Hydrochloride

<BR><BR>Synthesis of R-chloroquine
<BR><BR> As described in FIG. 1, (R)-(-)-chloroquine was prepared by condensing (R)-(-)-4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane with known 4,7-dichloroquinoline.  The (R)-(-)-4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane was prepared by resolving known racemic
(4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane via formation of a salt with known (D)-(-)-mandelic acid and separating the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salts of the two enantiomers by crystallization.
<BR><BR>Preparation of (R)-(-)-4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane
<BR><BR> To a solution of (D)-(-)-mandelic acid (100 g, 658 mmol) in 350 mL ethyl alcohol was slowly added racemic 4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane (98 g, 658 mmol).  The mixture was seeded with crystals of the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title
compound and, after standing overnight, the resulting solid was collected by filtration and rapidly washed two times with ice-cold ethanol to give the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound as white crystals (Crop 1).  The mother liquor was
concentrated until cloudiness was observed, then reheated until a homogenous solution resulted.  After seeding and standing overnight, the resulting solid was collected by filtration and rapidly washed two times with ice-cold ethanol to give a second
crop of the desired salt as white crystals (Crop 2).  The two salt crops (Crops 1 and 2) were combined to give a total of 44 g of the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound.  The above process was repeated 4 times.  Multiple batches of the
(D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound (150 g in total) were combined and then dissolved in ethyl alcohol with heating and sonication.  The solution was seeded and, after standing overnight, the resulting solid was collected by filtration and
rapidly washed two times with ice-cold ethanol to give the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound (Recrystallized Crop 1).  The mother liquor was concentrated and the residue dissolved in ethyl alcohol with heating and sonication.  The solution
was then seeded and, after standing overnight, the resulting solid was collected by filtration to give a second crop of the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound (Recrystallized Crop 2).  The mother liquor was concentrated and the residue was
dissolved in ethyl alcohol with heating and sonication.  The solution was then seeded and, after standing overnight, the resulting solid was collected by filtration to give a third crop of the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound
(Recrystallized Crop 3).  The three recrystallized crops (Recrystallized Crops 1, 2 and 3) were combined and dried in vacuo to give a total of 100 g of the (D)-(-)-mandelic acid salt of the title compound, [.alpha.].sub.D=-56.2 (1% in H.sub.2O).  This
salt was suspended in dichloromethane and washed three times with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution.  The organic layer was dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and concentrated in vacuo to give the title compound, which was used directly in the next step.
<BR><BR>Preparation of (R)-(-)-Chloroquine
<BR><BR> A mixture of the crude (R)-(-)-4-amino-1-(diethylamino)pentane from above (approximately 45 g, 285 mmol, 1.00 equivalents), 4,7-dichloroquinoline (56 g, 285 mmol, 1.00 equivalents) and phenol (53.6 g, 570 mmol, 2.0 equivalents) was heated to
120.degree.  C. for 18 h, then cooled to room temperature and diluted with dichloromethane.  The resulting mixture was washed with 1.5 M sodium hydroxide solution and the wash was back-extracted with dichloromethane.  The combined organic layers were
extracted with 1 M hydrochloric acid.  The aqueous extract was basified to pH 12 with saturated sodium carbonate solution and extracted with dichloromethane.  The organic extract was dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and concentrated in vacuo.  The residue was
then purified by column chromatography (silica gel eluting with 2.5% 7N NH.sub.3/MeOH) to give 42.8 g of the title compound.  [.alpha.].sub.D=-101.3 (1% in EtOH).
<BR><BR> This material was converted to its diphosphate salt by heating a solution of 42.8 g (133 mmol) of the title compound in ethyl alcohol to 90.degree.  C. for 15 min and adding dropwise two equivalents (314 g, 267 mmol) of 85% phosphoric acid. 
After heating the resulting suspension at reflux (90.degree.  C.) for 1 h and then cooling to room temperature, the solid was collected by filtration washed with ethanol and diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to give 68 g of (R)-(-)-chloroquine
diphosphate, [.alpha.].sub.D=-82.96 (2.1% in H.sub.2O).

<BR><BR>Synthesis and Purification of R-hydroxychloroquine
<BR><BR> The process for the synthesis and purification of enantiomers (R) and (S) hydroxychloroquine is fully described in Blaney, P. et al., "A Practical Synthesis of the Enantiomers of Hydroxychloroquine," Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 1994, pp.  1815-1822,
Vol. 5.  A summary of this process has been included below.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 6, the racemic diamine rac-2 is resolved by crystallization of its salt with S(+)mandelic acid.  Subsequent coupling with 4,7 dichloroquinoline gives S(+)-hydroxychloroquine ((S)-1a).  Similarly, using the opposite enantiomer of
mandelic acid gives (R)-2 and R(-)-hydroxychloroquine ((R)-1a).  Resolution of (R)-2 and (S)-2 involves crystalization of its diastereomeric mandelate salts from iso-propanol.  Using 0.5 molar equivalents of S(+)-mandelic acid and seeding the mixture
with pure diastereomer at 45.degree.  C., 67% of (S)-3 is recovered after a single crystallization with a diastereomeric excess (d.c.) of 92%.  Afterwards, (S)-3 or (R)-3 is hydrolyzed to the corresponding diamine (S)-2 or (R)-2.  Ratios and yields are
calculated without taking into account the presence of a variable quantity (up to 10%) of water in (S)-2 or (R)-2.
<BR><BR>Preparation of S(+)-5-[N-Ethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-pentanamine ((S)-2)
<BR><BR> A solution of rac-2 (200 g, 1.15 mol) in 2-propanol (350 ml) was added to a solution of (+)-mandelic acid (87.4 g, 0.575 mol) in 2-propanol (500 ml).  Additional 2-propanol was added to bring the total volume to 900 ml and the solution was
stirred overnight at room temperature.  Filtration gave white crystals (235 g) which were recrystallized twice more from 2-propanol (1800 mJ and 1600 ml respectively) to afford (S)-3 (145.4 g) as white crystals.  The solid was suspended in 35% aqueous
sodium hydroxide (350 ml) and extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether (5.times.600 ml).  The extracts were combined dried (MgSO.sub.4) and concentrated to give (S)-2 (55.5 g, 55%) as a colorless oil.  .sup.1H NMR (CDCl3) .delta.  0.98 (3H, t, J=7.1 Hz),

to 600 ml and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature.  Filtration gave white crystals (111g) which were recrystallized twice more from 2-propanol (1100 ml and 800 ml respectively) to afford (R)-3 (77.2 g) as white crystals.  .sup.1H NMR

<BR><BR> The Procedure for Assaying the Enantiomeric Purities of (R)-2 and (S)-2
<BR><BR> Fully resolved (R)-2 or (S)-2 has an [.alpha.].sub.D in the region of 6.  Reliable methods for determining enantiomeric purity involve .sup.1H-NMR of diastereomeric derivatives of (R)-2 and (S)-2.  The result of addition of one molar equivalent
of (R)-.alpha.-methoxy-.alpha.-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid (MTPA) to chloroform solutions of (R)-2 and (S)-2 causes resonances due to H.sup.a in the two diastereomers to broaden and move to higher frequency, while excess MTPA forms diastereomeric
salts in which the resonances due to H.sup.a and H.sup.b change position.  In the latter case, there is a large separation between the resonances due to H.sup.b of the two diastereomers.  This technique allows detection of as little as 1% of the minor
enantiomer.  It is suggested that monoprotonation gives a species which exists in a pseudocyclic form, whereas the diprotonated species exists in an acyclic form.  Similarly, in the .sup.1H NMR spectrum of the diastereomeric camphorsulfonamides, the
resonances due to the terminal methyl group of the diamine moiety are fully resolved, even at low field strength.  Conversion of resolved diamines (R)-2 and (S)-2 to the enantiomers of hydroxychloroquine, (R)-1a and (S)-1a, involves heating (R)-2 and
(S)-2 with 4,7-dichloroquinoline in the presence of diisopropylethylamine.  Optimum conditions are different for the two enantiomers: at 135.degree.  C., (S)-2 is consistently more prone to degradation than (R)-2, and the conversion is correspondingly
less clean.  Larger scale purification of (R)-1a and (S)-1a is performed by acid-base extraction.  Below pH 5, excess dichloroquinoline is removed from the aqueous phase, and the remaining impurities is removed by further extraction between pH 7 and pH
8, followed by charcoal treatment of the aqueous phase to remove a trace of highly-coloured material.  Above pH 8 (the most convenient pH being around 12), pure hydroxychloroquine is extracted.  Both (R)-1a and (S)-1a are oils, and require protection
from light during storage, developing a yellow color otherwise.  After purification, enantiomers (R)-1a and (S)-1a are converted to bis(dihydrogenphosphate) salts, ((R)-b and ((S)-1b), by treatment with phosphoric acid (two molar equivalents).  Where
triethylamine remained from the preceding chromatographic step, this is removed by trituration with acetone to leave a deliquescent hydrate.  Phosphoric acid (19.7 ml, 0.29 mol) was added to (S)-1a (43.4 g, 0.144 mol) with ice cooling to moderate the
reaction.  The resulting gum was ground under acetone and the resulting deliquescent solid was filtered quickly, suspended immediately in fresh acetone (200 ml), then stirred overnight.  Dehydration by heating in ethanolic suspension gives friable white
solids.  Rapid filtration gave a white powder which was transferred immediately into a flask containing ethanol (200 ml).  The resulting suspension was refluxed for four days, then filtered, and the solid washed with ethanol.  After drying under vacuum
to constant weight, the yield of (S)-1b was 52.6 g (69%).  (R)-1a is converted to bis(dihydrogenphosphate) salt in an analogous manner.  Both anhydrous samples and monohydrates melt at 192.degree.  C., substantially higher than the melting point of
168-170.degree.  C. reported for the racemate.  The enantiomers give substantial and reproducible rotations, and as little as 0.5% of the minor enantiomer can be detected by HPLC using a chiral AGP stationary phase.  Thus, both polarimetry and HPLC are
suitable for determination of the optical purity of the enantiomers.  Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also commercially available, and can be purchased from 3B Scientific Corporation.TM., (catalog No., DR001622).

<BR><BR> The clemizole and R-chloroquine of the invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions.  These compositions can comprise, in addition to clemizole and/or R-chloroquine, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer,
stabilizer or other materials well known to those skilled in the art.  Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient.  The precise nature of the carrier or other material can depend on the route of
administration, e.g. oral, intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous, nasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal routes.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form.  A tablet can include a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant.  Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally include a liquid carrier
such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil.  Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol can be included.
<BR><BR> For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and
stability.  Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection.  Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection.  Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers,
antioxidants and/or other additives can be included, as required.
<BR><BR> The small molecule useful compound according to the present invention that is to be given to an individual, administration is preferably in a "therapeutically effective amount" or "prophylactically effective amount" (as the case can be, although
prophylaxis can be considered therapy), this being sufficient to show benefit to the individual.  The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. 
Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors, and typically takes account of the disorder to be treated, the condition of the individual patient, the site of
delivery, the method of administration and other factors known to practitioners.  Examples of the techniques and protocols mentioned above can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Osol, A. (ed), 1980.
<BR><BR> A composition can be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.

<BR><BR>METHODS
<BR><BR> Induction of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
<BR><BR> NASH was induced in 55 male mice by a single subcutaneous injection of 200 .mu.g streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) solution 2 days after birth and feeding with high fat diet (HFD, 57 kcal % fat, cat#: HFD32, CLEA Japan, Inc., Japan) after
4 weeks of age.  Mice that had been induced have NASH by this method are referred to below as NASH mice.
<BR><BR> Pharmaceutical Compositions and Route of Drug Administration
<BR><BR> Compounds A, B, C, D and Vehicle were orally administered in a volume of 5 mL/kg.  Compound A comprised a recemic mixture of R-chloroquine and S-chloroquine.
<BR><BR> Compound B comprised R-chloroquine.  Compound C comprised S-chloroquine.
<BR><BR> Compound D comprised clemizole.  All test compounds were weighed and dissolved in vehicle (5% DMSO/Water).
<BR><BR> Treatment Doses of Drug
<BR><BR> Compounds A, B, and C were orally administered at doses of 258 mg/kg on the first 2 days and 129 mg/kg thereafter once daily.  Compound D was orally administered at doses of 89 mg/kg twice daily.  Table 1 below summarizes the treatment schedule.

<BR><BR> Animals
<BR><BR> C57BL/6 mice (14-day-pregnant female) were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc.  (Shizuoka, Japan).  All animals used in the study were housed and cared for in accordance with the Japanese Pharmacological Society Guidelines for Animal Use.
<BR><BR> Plasma Sampling and Measurement of Whole Blood and Plasma Biochemistry
<BR><BR> Non-fasting blood was collected in polypropylene tubes with anticoagulant (Novo-heparin, Mochida Pharmaceutical, Japan) from submandibular bleeding at 6 (before dosing), 7 and 8 weeks of age.  The collected blood samples were centrifuged and the
supernatant were collected as heparinized plasma.
<BR><BR> Non-fasting blood glucose in whole blood was measured using LIFE CHECK (EIDIA Co.  Ltd., Japan).  Plasma ALT was measured by FUJI DRI-CHEM 7000 (Fujifilm Corporation, Japan).
<BR><BR> Histopathological Analyses
<BR><BR> For HE staining, sections were cut from paraffin blocks of liver tissue prefixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Lillie-Mayer's Hematoxylin (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Japan) and eosin solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries).  NAFLD
Activity score (NAS) was calculated according to the criteria of Kleiner (Kleiner D E. et al., Hepatology, 2005; 41:1313).  To visualize collagen deposition, Bouin's fixed liver sections were stained using picro-Sirius red solution (Waldeck, Germany).
<BR><BR> For quantitative analysis of fibrosis areas bright field images of Sirius red-stained sections were captured around the central vein for livers using a digital camera (DFC280; Leica, Germany) at 200-fold magnification, and the positive areas in
5 fields/section were measured using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, USA).
<BR><BR> Macroscopic Analyses of Livers
<BR><BR> The number of macroscopically visible tumor nodules formed on the liver surface was measured.  The maximum diameter of macroscopically visible tumor nodules formed on the liver surface was measured.
<BR><BR> Statistical Tests
<BR><BR> Statistical analyses were performed using Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test on GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).  P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
<BR><BR>Example 1: Administration of S-Chloroquine Results in Reduced Liver and Body Weight in Mice with NASH

<BR><BR>Example 7: Human Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Treated with Clemizole
<BR><BR> A phase IIa, open label pilot study is conducted to test the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of 200 mg vs.  400 mg vs.  500 mg clemizole hydrochloride given orally thrice daily, to subjects with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) that are either awaiting liver transplantation or have an unresectable lesion.  The completed study treats up to 40 patients.  Initial clinical results from two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were administered 200 mg clemizole
for 3 or 5 months are described below.
<BR><BR> Patient #1 Summary:
<BR><BR> Patient #1 is a 70 year old man, diagnosed with HCC in the setting of chronic hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis.  Diagnosis was determined by dynamic liver CT.  Patient #1 had received radiofrequencey ablation treatment for HCC in 2011, but
experienced progression of disease post-treatment.  Patient #1 also received three courses of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in April-May 2015 and June 2015.  Patient #1 presented stable disease for a period of about 5 months prior to progression
of HCC.  The patient then began clemizole treatment with oral administration of 200 mg clemizole thrice daily.  After 3 months of clemizole treatment, the patient underwent follow up dynamic liver CT imaging, and when a significant increase in tumor size
would have been expected in the absence of any therapy, the HCC remained stable.  At that time, the patient felt well with no complaints or side effects.
<BR><BR> Patient #2 Summary:
<BR><BR> Patient #2 is a 77 year old man, diagnosed with multifocal HCC in the setting of chronic hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis.  Diagnosis was determined by dynamic liver magnetic resonance imaging.  Patient #2 had failed and/or not tolerated sorafenib
treatment and presented with disease progression post-treatment.  Patient #2 then initiated clemizole treatment with oral administration of 200 mg clemizole thrice daily.  After 5 months of clemizole treatment, the patient underwent follow up dynamic
liver magnetic resonance imaging, and when a significant increase in tumor size would have been expected in the absence of any therapy, the HCC remained stable.  At that time, the patient felt very well with no complaints or side effects.
<BR><BR> Although a small number of patients have been treated to date, the observed efficacy and tolerability with the low dose clemizole used (i.e. 200 mg vs.  up to 500 mg in subsequent patients) are very exciting in their own right, especially when
compared to the only approved therapy for HCC, sorafenib.  In the sorafenib phase 2 study (Abou-Alpha et al. Journal Clinical Oncology 2006, 24(26): 4293-4300), the median time to progression (TTP) was 4.2 months.  Toxicities included diarrhea in over
40%, hand-foot skin reaction in over 30%, and fatigue in 30%, including grade 3/4 drug-related toxicities such as fatigue (9.5%), diarrhea (8.0%), and hand-foot skin reaction (5.1%).  In the sorafenib phase 3 study (Llovet et al. NEJM 2008; 359:378-90),
the median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group.  The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 80% in the sorafenib group.  These were predominantly gastrointestinal,
constitutional, or dermatologic in nature (grade 1 or 2 in severity), as well as hypophosphatemia (11% grade 3) and thrombocytopenia (4% grade 3 or 4).
<BR><BR> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment and various alternate embodiments, it will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and details can
be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> All references, issued patents and patent applications cited within the body of the instant specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, for all purposes.
