<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to a co-crystal of the protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonist (or thrombin receptor antagonist) [(1R,3aR,4R,6R,8aR,9S,9aS)-9-[(E-2-[5-3-fluorophenyl]-2-pyridinyl)ethenyl-
]-dodecahydro-1-methyl-3-oxonaphtho[2,3-c]furan-6-yl]carbamate or vorapaxar and the cardiovascular agent acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin ("inventive co-crystal") The inventive co-crystal is a co-crystal of two compounds that the art recognizes as having
pharmaceutical activity, instead of the more typical situation where the co-crystal former is an inert spectator.  The inventive co-crystal may be expected to be useful in treating disease states such as acute coronary syndrome ("ACS") (unstable angina,
non-ST-segment elevation ("NSTE"), myocardial infarction ("MI"), and ST segment-elevation myocardial infarction ("STEW"), secondary prevention of myocardial infarction or thrombotic stroke ("secondary prevention") or peripheral artery diseases ("PAD"),
which is also known in the art as peripheral vascular disease.  The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inventive co-crystal as well as processes for their preparation.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Co-crystals are solid-state, crystalline materials that are composed of two or more molecules in the same crystal lattice.  Co-crystals are distinguishable from other pharmaceutical solid-state forms, such as polymorphs or salts, as these other
solid-state forms only contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") within the crystal lattice, whereas co-crystals are composed of an API with a guest compound in the crystal lattice.  Two or more of the molecules in a co-crystal are, neutral,
interact via nonionic interactions, and are solids at room temperature when isolated as individual components
<BR><BR> Typically, co-crystals are prepared by crystallizing an API with a guest compound.  Guest compounds are compounds that possess the ability to form complementary non-covalent interactions with the API.  General classes of guest compounds include
compounds having alcohol, ketone, ester and/or carboxylic acid functionalities.  Co-crystals of different APIs are known in the art.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,163,790 B2; U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,097,593; U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  8,003,700 and 8,039,475,
Co-crystals form in situations where favorable interactions between the individual components exist and one might expect to see improved physical properties, such as solubility, hygroscopicity and compaction behavior.  Sekhon, ARS Pharm., 50(3), pp
99-117 (2009).
<BR><BR> Thrombin is known to have a variety of activities in different cell types.  PAR-1 receptors are known to be present in such cell types as human platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.  It is expected that
PAR-1 receptor antagonists will be useful in the treatment of thrombotic, inflammatory, atherosclerotic and fibroproliferative disorders, as well as other disorders in which thrombin and its receptor play a pathological role.
<BR><BR> Substituted bi- and tricyclic thrombin receptors antagonists are known in the art and the art suggests that these receptor antagonists will treat thrombin receptor mediated disorders such as thrombosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, hypertension,
angina pectoris, angiogenesis related disorders, arrhythmia, a cardiovascular or circulatory disease or condition, heart failure, ACS, MI, glomerulonephritis, thrombotic stroke, thromboembolytic stroke, PAL), deep vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism,
a cardiovascular disease associated with hormone replacement therapy, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome and cerebral infarction, as well as CB.sub.2 receptor mediated disorders.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,304,048 or U.S.  Pat.  No.

<BR><BR> A PAR-1 receptor antagonist that exhibits good thrombin receptor antagonist activity (potency) and selectivity is vorapaxar (Merck & Co., Inc.), which has the following structure:
<BR><BR> ##STR00002## This compound has undergone clinical trials (TRA-CER and TRA 2.degree.P) and is disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,304,048.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,235,567 discloses the bisulfate salt of vorapaxar and indicates that this salt has at least
two crystalline polymorphic forms; viz., Form 1 and Form 2.  FIG. 1 is a powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of Form 1 of the bisulfate salt of vorapaxar and FIG. 2 is a PXRD of Form 2.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,235,567 indicates that Form 2 was found to be
unstable and reverted over time to the crystalline structure of Form 1.  An advantage of the inventive co-crystal is that they do not exist in other polymorphic forms or form solvates.
<BR><BR> U.S.  Patent Applications US 2008/0026050 A1; US 2008/0031943 A1; and US 2008/0152712 A1 disclose capsule formulations, tablet formulations and lyophilized formulations (respectively) of vorapaxar or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as
well methods of treating various conditions affected by antagonizing the PAR-1 receptor by administering same to a patient.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,304,048 and U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,235,567 describe inter alia pharmaceutical combinations of vorapaxar and aspirin. Other pharmaceutical combinations of vorapaxar and other cardiovascular agents are described in US 2007/023874 A1.
<BR><BR> There is a need to develop pharmaceutical formulations comprising vorapaxar as an active agent wherein vorapaxar exhibits polymorphic simplicity (i.e., does not form other polymorphic forms or solvates).  This and other objectives will become
evident from the following description.

<BR><BR> Sample Preparation
<BR><BR> Samples of a co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin were prepared as described in example 1, No particle size reduction or milling was performed and the material was analyzed as it was isolated.
<BR><BR> Powder X-Ray Diffraction
<BR><BR> The PXRD diffraction data was collected using a Kratos XRD 6000 diffractometer with a scintillation counter detector.  The sample was prepared by lightly packing the material into a glass sample holder followed by gentle smoothing to produce a
flat sample surface.  Copper (K.alpha.) radiation generated at 40.0 kV and 35.0 mA was used.  The slit dimensions were fixed at 0.50 degrees for divergence, 0.50 degrees for scattering, and 0.15 mm for receiving.  The sample was analyzed from 2 to 40
degrees 2 Theta with a step size of 0.02 degrees over step durations of 0.6 seconds.  Data analysis was conducted using Basic Process software version 2.6 supplied by Shimadzu.  The data was smoothed using the automatic smoothing process in the software.
<BR><BR> Using the methods and equipment described above, the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1) was subjected to PXRD analysis.  A PXRD pattern was generated and is displayed in FIG. 1.  The intensity of the peaks (y-axis is in counts
per second) is plotted versus the 2.theta.  angle (x-axis is in degrees 2.theta.).  In addition, the data were plotted with detector counts normalized for the collection time per step versus the 2.theta.  angle.  Peak locations (on the 2.theta.  X-axis)
consistent with these profiles are displayed in Table 1.  The locations of these PXRD peaks are characteristic of the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 PXRD Peak Positions for the Co-crystal of Vorapaxar and Asprin 2 Theta (Degrees) 6.2 7.7 9.4 11.0 12.4 13.0 14.2 14.7 15.4 16.9 18.1 18.9 19.3 19.7 20.5 21.7 21.9 23.0 23.4 24.1 25.0 26.4 27.1 27.6 28.0 29.8
<BR><BR> Starting with the PXRD peak locations of the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1) as displayed in Table 1, the most characteristic peak locations can be selected and grouped by relative intensity to conveniently distinguish this
crystalline structure from others.  This selection of unique peaks is displayed in Table 2.  Thus, the crystalline structure of the inventive co-crystal may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 1, consisting of four characteristic PXRD peak
locations.  In another embodiment, the crystalline structure of the inventive co-crystal may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 2, consisting of the four characteristic PXRD peak locations of Group No. 1 and an additional four peak locations. 
Still in another embodiment, the crystalline structure of the inventive co-crystal may be identified by the Peak Location Group No. 3, consisting of the eight characteristic PXRD peak locations of Group No. 2 and an additional four peak locations.
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2 Characteristic PXRD Peak Locations for the co-crystal of Vorapaxar and Aspirin Peak Location Peak Location Group No. (degrees 2) 1 16.9 18.1 23.0 20.5 2 16.9 18.1 23.0 20.5 23.4 19.3 14.2 24.1 3 16.9 18.1 23.0 20.5 23.4
19.3 14.2 24.1 7.7 18.9 25.0 21.9
<BR><BR> Those skilled in the art recognize that the measurements of the PXRD peak locations for a given crystalline form of the same compound will vary within a margin of error.
<BR><BR> A comparison of the PXRD pattern of FIG. 1 with the PXRD pattern of FIGS. 2 and 3 supports the conclusion that the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin is not polymorphic Form 1 or Form 2 of vorapaxar bisulfate.
<BR><BR> Differential Scanning Calorimry
<BR><BR> The DSC instrument used to test the co-crystal sample was a TA Instruments, model Q100 (New Castle, Del.).  Approximately 1 to 5 milligrams of sample were sealed in hermetic aluminum pans and two pinholes were punched into the lid of each sample
pan.  Analyses were conducted under a nitrogen purge of 50 mL per minute with a heating rate of 10.degree.  C. per minute.  The instrument was calibrated with high purity indium.  The accuracy of the measured sample temperature with this method is within
about +/-1.degree.  C., and the heat of fusion can be measured within a relative error of about +/-5%.  The heat flow, which was normalized by a sample weight, was plotted versus the measured sample temperature.  The data were reported in units of
watts/gram ("W/g").  The plot was made with the endothermic peaks pointing down.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 depicts a DSC profile for the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1).  FIG. 3 shows a single sharp melting endotherm with an extrapolated onset temperature of 147.6.degree.  C. and a peak temperature of 148.7.degree.  C.,
which is indicative of a single crystalline species.  The heat of fusion is 99.1 kg.  The combination of melt temperature and heat of fusion is used to distinguish this co-crystal from other crystalline forms.
<BR><BR> Thermogravimetric Analysis
<BR><BR> The instrument used to perform a TGA on the co-crystal sample was a TA Instruments, model Q50 (New Castle, Del.).  Approximately 5 to 15 milligrams of the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin were placed in a platinum pan and heated at 10.degree. C. per minute from room temperature to 300.degree.  C. under a nitrogen purge with a flow rate of 60 mL/min.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 shows the TGA data for the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1).  The data do not show any significant thermal decomposition or weight loss attributable to the presence of solvent or other volatiles is occurring below the
melting point of the co-crystal.
<BR><BR> Dynamic Vapor Sorption
<BR><BR> FIG. 6 depicts a DVS isotherm plot of the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1) performed on a DVS Intrinsic dynamic gravimetric sorption analyzer by Surface Measurement Systems Ltd (Alperton, Middlesex, UK).  Approximately 10 mg
of the co-crystal was placed on the sample pan for analysis.  The relative humidity was cycled from 5% to 95% to 5% in 10% increments at 25.degree.  C. while measuring the sample mass.  The equilibrium criterion (dm/dt) was set to 0.005.
<BR><BR> The DVS isotherm indicates that the co-crystal does not absorb a significant amount of water even at high relative humidity.
<BR><BR> Electrospray Mass Spectrometry and HPLC-UV
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 provides EMS data for vorapaxar, aspirin and the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin (molar ratio 1:1) and FIG. 8 is a plot comparing vorapaxar, aspirin and the co-crystal.  The data was collected on an Agilent Technologies LCMS, model
11MSD (Santa Clare, Calif., US) with electrospray ionization ("ES") in the positive scan mode.  The high-pressure liquid chromatograph was preformed on an Alliance 2695 by Waters Corp.  (Milford, Mass.  US) fitted with a photo array detector. 
Calculations were made using a signal observed at 215 nm.  "RT" denotes "retention time".
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 taken with FIG. 8 confirm that both vorapaxar and aspirin are present in the co-crystal and that the co-crystal is actually a co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin and is not a new crystal form of one of the components of the co-crystal or
a decomposition product of either vorapaxar or aspirin.
<BR><BR> Single-Crystal X-Ray Structure
<BR><BR> The single crystal structure of the vorapaxar-aspirin co-crystal was determined.  Single crystals were grown by slow evaporation from acetonitrile at 50.degree.  C. A single crystal with the approximate dimensions of 0.10 mm.times.0.50
mm.times.0.50 mm was mounted on a nylon loop with Paratone-N oil.  Data was acquired with a Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromated molybdenum K.alpha.  source (.lamda.=0.71073).  The data were integrated with the Balker
SAINT software package (v. 6.0) using a narrow-frame algorithm.  Data were corrected for absorption effects using the multi-scan method (SADABS).  The structure was solved and refined using the Balker SHELXTL.TM.  Software Package including SHELXS-97.
<BR><BR> The acquisition and cell parameters that were determined for the vorapaxar-aspirin co-crystal are shown in Table 3.  FIG. 9 is an ORTEP drawing of a single crystal structure of the vorapaxar-aspirin co-crystal.  The ORTEP drawing provides the
exact position in space of every atom within the co-crystal and can be used to generate a complete three dimensional image of the co-crystal.  These data provide confirmation that the inventive crystalline product is a co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin
and is not a co-crystal of a decomposition product of either component.  The single crystal structure also demonstrates the two molecules interact through hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen atom on the carboxylic acid functional group of aspirin and
the oxygen atom of the amide functional group on vorapaxar.  This hydrogen bonding arrangement and lack of proton transfer confirm that the complex is a co-crystal and not a salt.

<BR><BR> For preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inventive co-crystal, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid.  Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets
and suppositories.  The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient.  Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar and lactose.  Tablets, powders,
sachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), The Science and Practice of
Pharmacy, 20.sup.th Edition, (2000), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.
<BR><BR> Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.  As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions

<BR><BR> Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g., nitrogen.
<BR><BR> Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration.  Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.
<BR><BR> The co-crystal of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally.  The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as
are conventional in the art for this purpose.
<BR><BR> Typically, the co-crystal is administered orally, such as, for example, in a unit dosage form.  In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an
effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.
<BR><BR> The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood.  They should neither be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention nor limiting the invention in any way.
<BR><BR> Synthesis of the Co-Crystal of Vorapaxar and Aspirin
<BR><BR> Scheme 1 shows the reaction scheme to prepare the co-crystal of vorapaxar and aspirin.  Vorapaxar was synthesized internally using the procedure published in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,605,275.  Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and solvents were obtained
from commercial sources and used as received without any additional purification.  Approximately one molar equivalent of vorapaxar and approximately one molar equivalent of aspirin were stirred in a solvent such as toluene, heptane or a mixture of water
with methanol at room temperature.  The co-crystal was isolated by filtration or centrifugation followed by decantation of the supernatant.
<BR><BR> ##STR00003##
<BR><BR>Example 1
<BR><BR> A 100 mL round bottom flask was charged with vorapaxar (2.009 grams, 4.08 millimoles), acetylsalicylic acid (0.739 grams, 4.10 millimoles), and toluene (40 milliliters).  The mixture was stirred for 65 hours at room temperature then solids were
isolated by filtration.  Solids were washed with toluene (10 milliliters) then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 1 day to produce the co-crystal of vorapaxar and acetylsalicylic acid.
<BR><BR>Example 2
<BR><BR> A mortar was charged with vorapaxar (0.2643 grams, 0.536 millimoles) and acetylsalicylic acid (0.0971 grams, 0.539 millimoles) then ground with a pestle for 5 minutes.  Two drops of dimethylacetamide were then added to the mixture and grinding
continued for an additional 1 minute to produce the co-crystal of vorapaxar and acetylsalicylic acid.
<BR><BR>Example 3
<BR><BR> An 8 milliliter vial was charged with vorapaxar (0.1574 grams, 0.320 millimoles), acetylsalicylic acid (0.0582 grams, 0.323 millimoles), and heptane (5 milliliters).  The mixture was stirred for 9 days at room temperature then the vial was
centrifuged, the supernatant was decanted off of the solids, and the solids were dried under vacuum at room temperature to produce the co-crystal of vorapaxar and acetylsalicylic acid.
<BR><BR>Example 4
<BR><BR> An 8 milliliter vial was charged with vorapaxar (0.1477 grams, 0.300 millimoles), acetylsalicylic acid (0.0540 grams, 0.300 millimoles), and water (2 milliliters), The mixture was stirred for 1 day at room temperature, then methanol (0.50
milliliters) was added.  The mixture was stirred for an additional 8 days at room temperature.  The vial was then centrifuged, the supernatant was decanted off of the solids, and the solids were dried under vacuum at room temperature to produce the
co-crystal of vorapaxar and acetylsalicylic acid.
<BR><BR> While the present invention has been described with in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and other variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.  All such
alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
