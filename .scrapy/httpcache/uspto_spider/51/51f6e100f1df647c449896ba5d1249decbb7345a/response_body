<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to synergistic compositions for curing or preventing lipoxygenase mediated and free radical mediated disorders in mammals and various forms of degenerative musculoskeletal diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis.  The present invention further relates to compositions exhibiting synergistic inhibition of the expression and/or activity of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).  Particularly, the compositions comprise of an
enriched 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-.beta.-boswellic acid (AKBA), enriched demethylated curcuminoids and optionally containing other ingredients, which shows a synergistic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant property.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> Inflammatory diseases affect more than fifty million Americans.  As a result of basic research in molecular and cellular immunology over the last ten to fifteen years, approaches to diagnosing, treating and preventing these immunologically-based
diseases has been dramatically altered.  One example of this is the discovery of an inducible form of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.  Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX), first purified in 1976 and cloned in 1988, functions in the synthesis of prostaglandins
(PGs) from arachidonic acid (AA).  Three years after its purification, an inducible enzyme with COX activity was identified and given the name COX-2, while constitutive COX was termed COX-1.
<BR><BR> COX-2 gene expression is under the control of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.  Thus, the inference is that COX-2 functions in both inflammation and control of cell growth.  While COX-2 is inducible in many tissues, it is present
constitutively in the brain and spinal cord, where it may function in nerve transmission for pain and fever.  The two isoforms of COX are nearly identical in structure but have important differences in substrate and inhibitor selectivity and in their
intracellular locations.  Protective PGs, which preserve the integrity of the stomach lining and maintain normal renal function in a compromised kidney, are synthesized by COX-1.  On the other hand, PGs synthesized by COX-2 in immune cells are central to
the inflammatory process.  The discovery of COX-2 has made possible the design of new drugs and synergistic compositions that reduce inflammation without removing the protective PGs in the stomach and kidney made by COX-1.
<BR><BR> Leukotriens and 5(s)-HETE are important mediators for inflammatory, allergic and obstructive process.  Leukotriens increases micro vascular permeability and are potent chemo tactic agent.  Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase indirectly reduces the
expression of TNF-.alpha..  5-Lipoxygenase is therefore the target enzyme for identifying inhibitors, which have potential to cope with a variety of inflammation and hypersensitivity-based human diseases including asthma, arthritis, bowel diseases such
as ulcerative colitis and circulatory disorders such as shock and ischemia.
<BR><BR> Free radicals play a major role in the initiation and progression of a wide range of pathological diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cardiovascular disease.  In the food industry, free radicals have been found to be responsible
in the deterioration of foods during processing and storage.  In view of this, considerable attention has been given to the addition of antioxidants in foods and supplementation of antioxidants to biological systems to scavenge free radicals.
<BR><BR> A yellow pigmented fraction isolated from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa contains curcuminoids belonging to the dicinnamoyl methane group.  Curcuminoids are present to the extent of 3 to 5 percent in the raw material.  They are considered the
most important active ingredients and are believed to be responsible for the biological activity of Curcuma longa.  Though their major activity is anti-inflammatory, curcuminoids have been reported to possess antioxidant, antiallergic, wound healing,
antispasmodic, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and antiHIV activity as well.  Curcumin was isolated in 1815 and structurally defined in 1910.  Other major curcuminoids isolated from Curcuma longa include demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. 
Curcuminoids may be found in other botanicals in addition to Curcuma longa, such as Curcuma xanthorrhiza and Curcuma zedoaria.  Curcuminoids are well known for their anti-inflammatory activity.  Turmeric is one of the oldest anti-inflammatory drugs used
in Ayurvedic medicine.
<BR><BR> The pharmacokinetics involving the safety, toxicity, dose range and biological properties of turmeric and its components, including curcumin is known, and the turmeric is readily available in various food stores.
<BR><BR> The anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin were shown to inhibit the 5-lipoxygenase activity in rat peritoneal neutrophils as well as the 12-lipoxygenase and the cyclooxygenase activities in human platelets (Ammon, H. P. T. et al., J.
Ethopharmacol., 1993, 38, 113-119).  Curcumin had no significant effect on quercetin-induced nuclear DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and protein degradation and thus has the unique potential of acting as both pro- and antioxidants, depending on the redox
state of their biological environment (Saura, C. et al., Cancer Letters, 1992, 63, 237-241).
<BR><BR> Among the bibliographic references of the most interesting patents existing in the data banks, application FR2,655,054 about the cellular protection agents contained in curcuminoids obtained from Curcuma longa, ascorbic acid and/or dismutase
super oxide (DSO) stands out.  Curcuminoids have a known antioxidizing effect, as well as ascorbic acid and DSO that carry out a synergic effect.
<BR><BR> The gum resin of the plant Boswellia serrata (Burseraceae) has long been in use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and gout by the practitioners of Ayurvedic medicines in the Indian system of medicine.  Various extracts of the gum resin
have shown potent anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity in laboratory animals, as well as during clinical trials (Atal, C. K. et al., Ind.  J. Pharm., 1980, 12, 59; Pachnanda, V. K. et al., Ind.  J. Pharm., 1981, 13, 63).  In a detailed
pharmacological study, Singh et al have established that the alcoholic extract of B. serrata gum resin displayed marked anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan induced edema in rats and mice and dextran oedema in rats (Singh, G. B. et al., Agents and
Action, 1986, 18, 407).  It has also been recognized in the past that the ethanolic extract of the gum resin of B. serrata inhibits the formation of Leukotriene B4 in rat peritoneal neurophils.  Leukotriene B4 is one of the important mediators of
inflammatory reactions (Ammon, H. P. T. et al., Planta Medica, 1991, 57, 203).
<BR><BR> A composition of enriched demethylated curcuminoids, enriched 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-.beta.-boswellic acid (AKBA) and optionally other ingredients for preserving the health of joint tissues, for treating arthritis or other inflammatory conditions
with COX-2 and 5-LOX specificity has not yet been discovered.  A composition comprising demethylated curcuminoids, AKBA and optionally other ingredients to synergistically inhibit COX-2 and 5-LOX with high specificity and support the normalization of
joint function has also not yet been discovered.
<BR><BR> An important need therefore exists for dietary composition suitable for human patients that are synergistic in that they have stronger effects than the sum of the effects of the individual components and also synergistic with standard clinical
treatment of inflammatory conditions and in the prior art, there is no such synergistic 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory composition for inflammatory diseases.
<BR><BR> It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a non-toxic dietary supplement composition, which prevents or cure 5-lipoxygenase mediated disorders like inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and
periodontal disease), asthama, and bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and circulatory disorders such as shock and ischemia
<BR><BR> It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a composition for preventing free radical mediated disorders such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cardiovascular disease.
<BR><BR> Thus, it would be useful to identify an enriched natural composition that would specifically inhibit or prevent the synthesis of COX-2 and 5-LOX.  Such a composition, containing enriched demethylated curcuminoids, enriched AKBA, which would be
useful for preserving the health of joint tissues, for treating arthritis or other inflammatory conditions, asthma, bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and circulatory disorders such as shock and ischemia has not previously been discovered.

<BR><BR> The invention is further explained with the help of the following examples:
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>Synergestic 5-lipoxygenase Inhibitory Activity
<BR><BR> The new dietary supplement compositions are screened for their 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory potential using colorimetric method.  The assay mixture contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.3), 5-lipoxygenase, various concentrations of test
composition (5 .mu.g, 10 .mu.g, 20 .mu.g) in dimethylsulphoxide and linolenic acid in a total volume of 0.5 mL, after 5 min incubation of above reaction mixture 0.5 mL ferric xylenol orange reagent is added and OD is measured after two minutes at 585 nm
using spectrophotometer.  Controls are run along with test in a similar manner except using vehicle instead of test substance solution.  Percent inhibition is calculated by comparing absorbance of test solution with that of control.
<BR><BR> The results are illustrated in the following table
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00009 TABLE 1 5-Lipoxygenase inhibitory activity % of inhibition S. No. Name of the compound 5 .mu.g 10 .mu.g 20 .mu.g 1 Composition 1 22.4 34.1 49.7 2 Composition 2 29.3 39.9 49.2 3 Composition 3 44.5 57.5 64.14 4 Composition 4 19.4
27.3 45.1 5 Composition 5 9.1 14.9 34.9 6 Composition 6 15.6 22.7 36.5 7 Composition 7 17.1 24.1 44.5 8 Composition 8 12.5 25.6 53.2 9 Enriched AKBA extract 0 12.5 32.7 10 Enriched demethylated 33.9 62.9 67.5 curcuminoids The higher the % inhibition
values, the higher the activity.
<BR><BR> From the above 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory values (Table 1), it clearly shows the synergism of the compositions.  For example, at 5 .mu.g concentration, the enriched demethylated curcuminoids and enriched AKBA extract exhibited 33.9% and 0%
inhibition respectively.  Whereas the composition 3, which contains 1:1 ratio of enriched demethylated curcuminoids and enriched AKBA extract exhibited 44.5% inhibition.  This inhibitory value of the composition is higher than the individual components.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>Antioxidant Activity of the Compositions
<BR><BR> The dietary supplement compositions are screened for their antioxidant activity by superoxide free radical-scavenging method.  The superoxide free radical-scavenging activity is determined by the NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) method.  The
reaction mixture contained EDTA (6.6 mM), NaCN (3 .mu.m), riboflavin (2 NBT (50 .mu.M), various concentrations of the test compositions in ethanol and a phosphate buffer (58 mM, pH 7.8) in a final volume of 3 ml.  Optical density is measured at 560 nm. 
The test tubes are uniformly illuminated with an incandescent lamp for 15 min, after which the optical density is measured again at 560 nm.  The percentage inhibition and superoxide radical generation is measured by comparing the absorbance values of the
control and those of the test compounds.
<BR><BR> The dietary supplement compositions are screened for their antioxidant activity by DPPH method.  DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity is measured based on the reduction of methanolic solution of the colored DPPH. 
Free radical scavenging ability of the test compositions in ethanol added to the methanolic solution of DPPH is inversely proportional to the difference in initial and final absorption of DPPH solution at 516 nm.  The reaction mixture contained
1.times.10.sup.-4 mM methanolic solution of DPPH and various concentrations of test drugs.  The percentage inhibition is determined by comparing the absorbance values of test and control tubes.
<BR><BR> The results are illustrated in the following table:
<BR><BR> TABLE-US-00010 TABLE 2 Antioxidant activity Superoxide (NBT) DPPH S. No. Name of the compound IC.sub.50 .mu.g IC.sub.50 .mu.g 1 Composition 1 26.0 2.88 2 Composition 2 16.5 2.62 3 Composition 3 7.5 1.33 4 Composition 4 50.0 13.06 5 Composition 5

<BR><BR> The above antioxidant activity data (Table 2) reveled that all the compositions exhibited good antioxidant activity.  Further, these compositions are potent antioxidant agents in comparison with commercially available antioxidants like Vitamin E
etc.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
